## Prerequisites

* You have installed the following applications on your host.
  
  | Application    | Recommended version | Official installation reference                                    |
  | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Docker         | Latest              | [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)   |
  | Docker Compose | Latest              | [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) |
  | Git            | Latest              | [Download Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)       |

* If you are deploying Nebula Graph as a non-root user, grant the user with Docker-related privileges. For a detailed instruction, see [Docker docs: Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

* You have started the Docker service on your host.

* If you have already deployed another version of Nebula Graph with Docker Compose on your host, to avoid compatibility issues，back up [the service data](#check-the-service-data-and-logs) if you need, and delete the `nebula-docker-compose/data` directory.

## How to deploy

1. Clone the `v2-preview` branch of the `nebula-docker-compose` repository to your host with Git.

[TODO: Update the branch name on the release on 2.0 alfa.]

> **DON'T**: The `v2-preview` branch stores the Docker Compose solution for the latest Nebula Graph development release, the 2.0 pre-release. DON'T use this release for production.

    ```bash
    $ git clone --branch v2-preview https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose.git
    ```

1. Go to the `nebula-docker-compose` directory.

    ```bash
    $ cd nebula-docker-compose/
    ```

2. Run the following command to start all the Nebula Graph services.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

    The following information indicates the services have started:

    ```bash
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad2_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad1_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad0_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged2_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_graphd_1    ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged0_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged1_1 ... done
    ```

    >**NOTE**: For more information of the preceding services, see [Design and Architecture of Nebula Graph](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/1.overview/3.design-and-architecture/1.design-and-architecture/).

3. Use nebula-console to connect to Nebula Graph.

    [Nebula-console](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-console) is the native CLI client of Nebula Graph. In this step, Docker pulls the nebula-console images automatically from Docker Hub according to the path we set in the following commands and uses it to connect to the graphd service of Nebula Graph. You can use other clients to connect to Nebula Graph instead of Nebula-console, such as [Nebula Graph Studio](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-web-docker) and [clients for different programming languages](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/1.overview/2.quick-start/3.supported-clients/).

    ```bash
    $ docker run --rm -ti --network nebula-docker-compose_nebula-net vesoft/nebula-console:v2-preview-nightly --address=graphd --port=3699 -u <username> -p <password>
    ```

    [TODO: Update the tag on the release on 2.0 alfa.]

    >**NOTE**: The default username is `root` and the default password is `nebula`.

    The following information indicates that you have connected to the Nebula Graph services:

    ```bash
    Welcome to Nebula Graph (Version 5d10861)

    (user@127.0.0.1) [(none)]>
    ```

## Check the Nebula Graph service status and ports

Run `docker-compose ps` to list the service information of Nebula Graph, such as state and ports.

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
              Name                             Command                  State                                                Ports

```

>**NOTE**: 
> * Nebula Graph provides services to the clients through port TCP3699 by default. You can adjust the port number by modifying the [network configurations](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/3.build-develop-and-administration/3.configurations/3.meta-config/#networking_configurations).
> * To check the machine status and partition distribution in the Nebula Graph cluster, run `SHOW HOSTS` in nebula-console when it is connected to the cluster.

## Check the service data and logs

All the data and logs of Nebula Graph are stored persistently in the `nebula-docker-compose/data` and `nebula-docker-compose/logs` directories.

The structure of the directories is as follows:

```text
nebula-docker-compose/
  |-- docker-compose.yaml
  |-- data
  |     |- meta0
  |     |- meta1
  |     |- meta2
  |     |- storage0
  |     |- storage1
  |     `- storage2
  `-- logs
        |- meta0
        |- meta1
        |- meta2
        |- storage0
        |- storage1
        |- storage2
        `- graph
```

## Stop the Nebula Graph services

You can run the following command to stop the Nebula Graph services:

```bash
$ docker-compose down

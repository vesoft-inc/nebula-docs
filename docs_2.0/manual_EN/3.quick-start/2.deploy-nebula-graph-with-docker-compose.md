## Prerequisites

* You have installed the following applications on your host.
  
  | Application    | Recommended version | Official installation reference                                    |
  | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Docker         | Latest              | [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)   |
  | Docker Compose | Latest              | [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) |
  | Git            | Latest              | [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)       |

* If you are deploying Nebula Graph as a non-root user, grant the user with Docker-related privileges. For a detailed instruction, see [Docker docs: Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

* You have started the Docker service on your host.

* If you have already deployed another version of Nebula Graph with Docker Compose on your host, to avoid compatibility issuesï¼Œback up [the service data](#check-the-service-data-and-logs) if you need, and delete the `nebula-docker-compose/data` directory.

## How to deploy

1. Clone the `v2-preview` branch of the `nebula-docker-compose` repository to your host with Git.

[TODO: Update the branch name on the release on 2.0 alpha.]

> **DON'T**: The `v2-preview` branch stores the Docker Compose solution for the latest Nebula Graph development release, the 2.0 pre-release. DON'T use this release for production.

    ```bash
    $ git clone --branch v2-preview https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose.git
    ```

2. Go to the `nebula-docker-compose` directory.

    ```bash
    $ cd nebula-docker-compose/
    ```

3. Run the following command to start all the Nebula Graph services.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

    The following information indicates the services have started:

    ```bash
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad2_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad1_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad0_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged2_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_graphd_1    ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged0_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged1_1 ... done
    ```

    >**NOTE**: For more information of the preceding services, see [Design and Architecture of Nebula Graph](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/1.overview/3.design-and-architecture/1.design-and-architecture/).

4. Use nebula-console to connect to Nebula Graph.

    [Nebula-console](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-console) is the native CLI client of Nebula Graph. In this step, Docker pulls the nebula-console images automatically from Docker Hub according to the path you set in the following commands and uses it to connect to the Graph Service of Nebula Graph.
    <!-- You can use other clients to connect to Nebula Graph instead of Nebula-console, such as [Nebula Graph Studio](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-web-docker) and [clients for different programming languages](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/1.overview/2.quick-start/3.supported-clients/). -->

    ```bash
    $ docker run --rm -ti --network nebula-docker-compose_nebula-net vesoft/nebula-console:v2-preview-nightly --address=graphd --port=3699 -u <username> -p <password>
    ```

    [TODO: Update the docker image tag on the release of 2.0 alpha.]

    >**NOTE**: By default, the authentication is disabled. When the authentication is enabled, use the default username `root` and its password `nebula`.

    The following information indicates that you have connected to the Nebula Graph services:

    ```bash
    Welcome to Nebula Graph v2.0.0-alpha!

    (user@nebula) [(none)]>
    ```

## Check the Nebula Graph service status and port

Run `docker-compose ps` to list all the services of Nebula Graph and their status and ports.

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
              Name                             Command                  State                                                Ports

```

>**NOTE**:
>
> * Nebula Graph provides services to the clients through port 3699 by default. You can adjust the port number by modifying the [network configurations](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/3.build-develop-and-administration/3.configurations/3.meta-config/#networking_configurations).
> * To check the machine status and partition distribution, run the `SHOW HOSTS` statement.

## Check the service data and logs

All the data and logs of Nebula Graph are stored persistently in the `nebula-docker-compose/data` and `nebula-docker-compose/logs` directories.

The structure of the directories is as follows:

```text
nebula-docker-compose/
  |-- docker-compose.yaml
  |-- data
  |     |- meta0
  |     |- meta1
  |     |- meta2
  |     |- storage0
  |     |- storage1
  |     `- storage2
  `-- logs
        |- meta0
        |- meta1
        |- meta2
        |- storage0
        |- storage1
        |- storage2
        `- graph
```

## Stop the Nebula Graph services

You can run the following command to stop the Nebula Graph services:

```bash

# Nebula Graph CRUD

This topic describes the basic CRUD operations in Nebula Graph.

## Graph space and Nebula Graph schema

A Nebula Graph instance consists of one or more graph spaces. Graph spaces are physically isolated from each other. You can use different graph spaces in the same instance to store different datasets.

![Nebula Graph and graph spaces](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/docs_2.0/3.quick-start/nebula_graph_instance_and_graph_spaces.png)

To insert data into a graph space, define a schema for the graph database. Nebula Graph schema is based on the following components.

| Schema component | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   |
| Vertex           | Represents an entity in the real world. A vertex can have one or more tags.               |
| Tag              | The type of a vertex. It defines a group of properties that describes a type of vertices. |
| Edge             | Represents a **directed** relationship between two vertices.                              |
| Edge type        | The type of an edge. It defines a group of properties that describes a type of edges.     |

For more information, see [Nebula Graph schema](TODO) [TODO].

In this topic, we use the following dataset to demonstrate basic CRUD operations.

![The demo dataset](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/docs_2.0/3.quick-start/demo_dataset_for_quick_start.png)

## Check the machine status in the Nebula Graph cluster

First, we recommend that you check the machine status to make sure that all the Storage services are connected to the Meta Services. Run `SHOW HOSTS` as follows.

```nGQL
(root@nebula) [(none)]> SHOW HOSTS;
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| Host      | Port  | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution | Partition distribution |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| storaged0 | 44500 | ONLINE | 0            | No valid partition  | No valid partition     |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| storaged1 | 44500 | ONLINE | 0            | No valid partition  | No valid partition     |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| storaged2 | 44500 | ONLINE | 0            | No valid partition  | No valid partition     |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
Got 3 rows (time spent 1775/2334 us)
```

From the **Status** column of the table in the return message, you can see that all the Storage services are online.

## Create and use a graph space

### nGQL syntax

* Create a graph space:

    ```nGQL
    CREATE SPACE <graph_space_name> [(partition_num=<partition number>, replica_factor=<replica number>), vid_type=fixed_string(<string_number>))];
    ```

    | Property       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | partition_num  | Specifies the number of partitions in each replica. The suggested number is the number of hard disks in the cluster times 5. For example, if you have 3 hard disks in the cluster, we recommend that you set 15 partitions.           |
    | replica_factor | Specifies the number of replicas in the Nebula Graph cluster. The suggested number is 3 in a production environment and 1 in a test environment. The replica number must always be an odd number for the need of quorum-based voting. |
    |vid_type | To insert a vertex with a string-typed VID, set the `fixed_string` length for the maximum VID length. The default `fixed_string` is 8. Note: `fix_string(N)` is similar to `varchar(N)` in SQL.|

* List graph spaces:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> SHOW SPACES;
    ```

* Use a graph space:

    ```nGQL
    USE <graph_space_name>
    ```

### Examples

1. Use the following statement to create a graph space named `nba`.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> CREATE SPACE nba(partition_num=15, replica_factor=1, vid_type=fixed_string(30));
    Execution succeeded (time spent 2817/3280 us)
    ```

2. Check the partition distribution with `SHOW HOSTS` to make sure that the partitions are distributed in a balanced way.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
    +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
    | Host      | Port  | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution | Partition distribution |
    +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
    | storaged0 | 44500 | ONLINE | 1            | nba:5               | nba:5                  |
    +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
    | storaged1 | 44500 | ONLINE | 1            | nba:5               | nba:5                  |
    +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
    | storaged2 | 44500 | ONLINE | 1            | nba:5               | nba:5                  |
    +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
    Got 3 rows (time spent 744/1123 us)
    ```

    If the **Leader distribution** is uneven, use `BALANCE LEADER` to redistribute the partitions. For more information, see [BALANCE](TODO) [TODO].

3. Use the `nba` graph space.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> USE nba;
    Execution succeeded (time spent 1322/2206 us)
    ```

    You can use `SHOW SPACES` to check the graph space you created.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> SHOW SPACES;
    +------+
    | Name |
    +------+
    | nba  |
    +------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 1235/1934 us)
    ```

## Create tags and edge types

### nGQL syntax

```nGQL
CREATE {TAG | EDGE} {<tag_name> | <edge_type>}(<property_name> <data_type>
[, <property_name> <data_type> ...]);
```

### Examples

Create tags `player` and `team`, edge types `follow` and `serve`.

| Component name | Type | Property |
| -------------- | ---- | -------- |
| player         | Tag       | name (string), age (int)         |
| team           | Tag       | name (string)                    |
| follow         | Edge type | degree (int)                     |
| serve          | Edge type | start_year (int), end_year (int) |

```nGQL
nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int);
Execution succeeded (time spent 2694/3116 us)

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 06:22:29 UTC

nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string);
Execution succeeded (time spent 2630/3002 us)

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 06:22:37 UTC

nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int);
Execution succeeded (time spent 3087/3467 us)

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 06:22:43 UTC

nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int);
Execution succeeded (time spent 2645/3123 us)

Thu, 15 Oct 2020 06:22:50 UTC
```

## Insert vertices and edges

You can use the `INSERT` statement to insert vertices or edges based on existing tags or edge types.

### nGQL syntax

* Insert vertices:

    ```nGQL
    INSERT VERTEX <tag_name> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...])
    [, <tag_name> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]), ...]
    {VALUES | VALUE} <vid>: (<property_value>[, <property_value>...])
    [, <vid>: (<property_value>[, <property_value>...];
    ```

    `VID` is short for vertex ID. A `VID` must be a unique string value in a graph space.

* Insert edges:

    ```nGQL
    INSERT EDGE <edge_type> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...])
    {VALUES | VALUE} <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] : (<property_value>[, <property_value>...])
    [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank> : (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]), ...]
    ```

### Examples

* Insert vertices representing NBA players and teams:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player100":("Tim Duncan", 42);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 2919/3485 us)

    Fri, 16 Oct 2020 03:41:00 UTC

    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player101":("Tony Parker", 36);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 3007/3539 us)

    Fri, 16 Oct 2020 03:41:58 UTC

    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player102":("LaMarcus Aldridge", 33);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 2449/2934 us)

    Fri, 16 Oct 2020 03:42:16 UTC

    nebula> INSERT VERTEX team(name) VALUES "team200":("Warriors"), "team201":("Nuggets");
    Execution succeeded (time spent 3514/4331 us)

    Fri, 16 Oct 2020 03:42:45 UTC
    ```

* Insert edges representing the relations between NBA players and teams:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player100" -> "player101":(95);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 1488/1918 us)

    Wed, 21 Oct 2020 06:57:32 UTC

    nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player100" -> "player102":(90);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 2483/2890 us)

    Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:05:48 UTC

    nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player102" -> "player101":(75);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 1208/1689 us)

    Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:07:12 UTC

    nebula> INSERT EDGE serve(start_year, end_year) VALUES "player100" -> "team200":(1997, 2016), "player101" -> "team201":(1999,  2018);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 2170/2651 us)

    Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:08:59 UTC
    ```

## Read data

You can use the statements [GO](TODO) [TODO], [FETCH](TODO) [TODO], and [LOOKUP](TODO) [TODO] to retrieve vertex and edge data.

* `GO` is the most commonly used read statement. It traverses the database based on specific conditions. A `GO` traversal starts from one or more vertices, along one or more edges, and return information in a form specified in the `YIELD` clause.
* `FETCH` is used to get properties from vertices or edges.
* The `LOOKUP` statement is based on [indexes](#about-indexes). It is used together with the `WHERE` clause to search for the data that meet the specific conditions.

### nGQL syntax

* `GO`

    ```nGQL
    GO [[<M> TO] <N> STEPS ] FROM <vertex_list>
    OVER <edge_type_list> [REVERSELY] [BIDIRECT]
    [WHERE <expression> [AND | OR expression ...])]
    YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list>
    ```

* `FETCH`

  * Fetch properties on tags:

    ```nGQL
    FETCH PROP ON {<tag_name> | <tag_name_list> | *} <vid_list>
    [YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list>]
    ```

  * Fetch properties on edges:

    ```nGQL
    FETCH PROP ON <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>]
    [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid> ...]
    [YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list>]
    ```

* `LOOKUP`

    ```nGQL
    LOOKUP ON {<tag_name> | <edge_type>} WHERE <expression> [AND expression ...])]
    [YIELD <return_list>]
    ```

### Examples

* Use `GO`: Find the vertices that VID "player100" follows.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow;
    +-------------+
    | follow._dst |
    +-------------+
    | player101   |
    +-------------+
    | player102   |
    +-------------+
    Got 2 rows (time spent 1935/2420 us)
    ```

* Use `GO`: Search for the players that the player with VID "player100" follows. Filter the the players that the player with VID "player100" follows whose age is equal to or greater than 35. Rename the columns in the result with `Teammate` and `Age`.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow WHERE $$.player.age >= 35 \
    YIELD $$.player.name AS Teammate, $$.player.age AS Age;
    +-------------+-----+
    | Teammate    | Age |
    +-------------+-----+
    | Tony Parker | 36  |
    +-------------+-----+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 3871/4349 us)
    ```

    |Clause/Sign|Description|
    |-|-|
    |`YIELD`|Specifies what values or results you want to return from the query.|
    |`$$`|Represents the target vertices.|
    |`\`|A line-breaker.|

* Use `GO`: Search for the players that the player with VID "player100" follows. Then Retrieve the teams of the players that the player with VID "player100" follows. To combine the two queries, use a pipe or a temporary variable.

  * With a pipe:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD follow._dst AS id | \
    GO FROM $-.id OVER serve YIELD $$.team.name AS Team, \
    $^.player.name AS Player;
    +---------+-------------+
    | Team    | Player      |
    +---------+-------------+
    | Nuggets | Tony Parker |
    +---------+-------------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 2902/3496 us)
    ```

    |Clause/Sign|Description|
    |-|-|
    |`$^`|Represents the source vertex of the edge.|
    |`\`||A pipe symbol that can combine multiple queries.|
    |`$-`|Represents the output of the query before the pipe symbol.|

  * With a temporary variable:

    > **NOTE**: Once a compound statement is submitted to the server as a whole, the life cycle of the temporary variables in the statement ends.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> $var = GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD follow._dst AS id; \
    GO FROM $var.id OVER serve YIELD $$.team.name AS Team, \
    $^.player.name AS Player;
    +---------+-------------+
    | Team    | Player      |
    +---------+-------------+
    | Nuggets | Tony Parker |
    +---------+-------------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 3103/3711 us)
    ```

* Use `FETCH`: Fetch the properties of the player with VID player100.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player100";
    +----------+-------------+------------+
    | VertexID  | player.name | player.age |
    +----------+-------------+------------+
    | player100 | Tim Duncan  | 42         |
    +----------+-------------+------------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 2006/2406 us)
    ```

* Use `LOOKUP`: Find the information of the vertex with the tag `player` and its value of the `name` property is `"Tony Parker"`.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == "Tony Parker" \
    YIELD player.name, player.age;
    ```

## Update vertices and edges

You can use the `UPDATE` statement or the `UPSERT` statement to update existing data.

`UPSERT` is the combination of `UPDATE` and `INSERT`. If you update a vertex or an edge with `UPSERT`, it inserts a new vertex or edge if it does not exist.

### nGQL syntax

* `UPDATE` vertices:

```nGQL
UPDATE VERTEX <vid> SET <properties to be updated>
[WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]
```

* `UPDATE` edges:

```nGQL
UPDATE EDGE <source vid> -> <destination vid> [@rank] OF <edge_type>
SET <properties to be updated> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns to be output>]
```

* `UPSERT` vertices or edges:

```nGQL
UPSERT {VERTEX <vid> | EDGE <edge_type>} SET <update_columns>
[WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]
```

### Examples

* `UPDATE` the `name` property of the vertex with VID "player100" and check the result with the `FETCH` statement:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> UPDATE VERTEX "player100" SET player.name = "Tim";
    Execution succeeded (time spent 3483/3914 us)

    Wed, 21 Oct 2020 10:53:14 UTC

    nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player100";
    +----------+-------------+------------+
    | VertexID  | player.name | player.age |
    +----------+-------------+------------+
    | player100 | Tim         | 42         |
    +----------+-------------+------------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 2463/3042 us)
    ```

* `UPDATE` the degree value of an edge and check the result with the `FETCH` statement:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> UPDATE EDGE "player100" -> "player101" OF follow SET degree = 96;
    Execution succeeded (time spent 3932/4432 us)

    nebula> FETCH PROP ON follow "player100" -> "player101";
    +-------------+-------------+--------------+---------------+
    | follow._src | follow._dst | follow._rank | follow.degree |
    +-------------+-------------+--------------+---------------+
    | player100   | player101   | 0            | 96            |
    +-------------+-------------+--------------+---------------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 2205/2800 us)
    ```

* Insert a vertex with VID "player111" and `UPSERT` it.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player111":("Ben Simmons", 22);
    Execution succeeded (time spent 2115/2900 us)

    Wed, 21 Oct 2020 11:11:50 UTC

    nebula> UPSERT VERTEX "player111" SET player.name = "Dwight Howard", player.age = $^.player.age + 11 \
    WHEN $^.player.name == "Ben Simmons" AND $^.player.age > 20 \
    YIELD $^.player.name AS Name, $^.player.age AS Age;
    +---------------+-----+
    | Name          | Age |
    +---------------+-----+
    | Dwight Howard | 33  |
    +---------------+-----+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 1815/2329 us)
    ```

## Delete vertices and edges

### nGQL syntax

* Delete vertices:

```nGQL
DELETE VERTEX <vid1>[, <vid2>...]
```

* Delete edges:

```nGQL
DELETE EDGE <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>]
[, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>...]
```

### Examples

* Delete vertices:

```nGQL
nebula> DELETE VERTEX "team1", "team2";
Execution succeeded (time spent 4337/4782 us)
```

* Delete edges:

```nGQL
nebula> DELETE EDGE follow "team1" -> "team2";
Execution succeeded (time spent 3700/4101 us)
```

## About indexes

You can add indexes to tags or edge types with the `CREATE INDEX` statement. For more information, see [Nebula Graph indexes](TODO) [TODO].

### Must-read for using index

* Applicable use of indexes can speed up queries, but indexes also decrease the write performance. **DO NOT** use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service.

* Rebuild indexes for pre-existing data. Otherwise, the pre-existing data can't be indexed. For more information, see [Rebuild indexes](TODO) [TODO].

### nGQL syntax

Create an index:

```nGQL
CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name>
ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} (prop_name_list);
```

Rebuild an index:

```ngql
REBUILD {TAG | EDGE} INDEX <index_name>
```

### Examples

Create an index for the `name` property on all vertices with the tag `player`.

```nGQL
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX player_index_0 on player(name);
nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX player_index_0;
```

## FAQ

### How is the time spent value at the end of each return message calculated?

Take the return message of `SHOW SPACES` as an example:

```nGQL
nebula> SHOW SPACES;
+------+
| Name |
+------+
| nba  |
+------+
Got 1 rows (time spent 1235/1934 us)
```

* The first number 1235 shows the time spent by the database itself, that is, the time it takes for the query engine to receive a query from the client, fetch the data from the storage server and perform a series of calculation.

* The second number 1934 shows the time spent from the client's perspective, that is, the time it takes for the client from sending a request, receiving a response, and displaying the result on the screen.

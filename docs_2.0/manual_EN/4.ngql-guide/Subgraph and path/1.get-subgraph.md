# GET SUBGRAPH

The `GET SUBGRAPH` statement retrieves information of vertices and edges reachable from the start vertex over the specified edges.

## Syntax

```nGQL
GET SUBGRAPH [<step_count> STEPS] FROM {<vid>, <vid>...}
[IN <edge_type>, <edge_type>...]
[OUT <edge_type>, <edge_type>...]
[BOTH <edge_type>, <edge_type>...]
```

|Clause|Description|
|-|-|
|`STEPS`|Specifies the steps to go from the start vertices. A `step_count` must be an non-negative integer. Its default value is 1.|
|`FROM`|Specifies the start vertices.|
|`IN`|Get subgraph from the start vertices over the specified ingoing edges (edges pointing to the start vertices).|
|`OUT`|Get subgraph from the start vertices over the specified outgoing edges (edges pointing out from the start vertices).|
|`BOTH`|Get subgraph from the start vertices over the specified types of edges, both ingoing and outgoing.|

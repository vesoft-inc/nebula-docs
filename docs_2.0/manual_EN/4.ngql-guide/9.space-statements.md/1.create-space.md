# CREATE SPACE syntax

```ngql
CREATE SPACE <graph_space_name>
    [(partition_num = <partition number>, replica_factor = <replica number>, charset = <charset>, collate = <collate>,
    vid_type = FIXED_STRING(<string_number>))]
```

The `CREATE SPACE` statement creates a new graph space with the given name. A `SPACE` is a region that provides physically isolated graphs in Nebula Graph. An error occurs if the database exists.

## IF NOT EXISTS

You can use the `IF NOT EXISTS` keywords when creating spaces. This keyword automatically detects if the corresponding space exists. If it does not exist, a new one is created. Otherwise, no space is created.

> **NOTE**: The space existence detection here only compares the space name (excluding properties).

## Graph space name

* **graph_space_name**

    The name uniquely identifies a graph space on a host.

## Customized graph space options

There are four optional customized graph space options when creating a graph database:

* `partition_num`

    Specifies the number of partitions in each replica. The suggested number is five times of the hard disks number in the cluster. For example, if you have 3 hard disks in the cluster, we recommend that you set 15 partitions.

* `replica_factor`

    Specifies the number of replicas in the cluster. The default replica factor is 1. The suggested number is 3 in a production environment and 1 in a test environment. Always set the replica to an odd number for the need of quorum-based voting.

* `charset`

    Short for character set. A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. The default value is utf8.

* `collate`

    A set of rules for comparing characters in a character set. The default value is utf8_bin.

* `vid_type`

    To insert a vertex with a string-typed VID, set the `fixed_string` length for the maximum VID length. The default `fixed_string` is 8. The `fix_string(N)` in nGQL is similar to `varchar(N)` in SQL.

If no option is given, Nebula Graph creates the graph space with the default options.

## Example

```ngql
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_1; -- create space with default partition number and replica factor
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_2(partition_num=10); -- create space with default replica factor
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_3(replica_factor=1); -- create space with default partition number
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_4(partition_num=10, replica_factor=1);
```

## Check partition distribution

On some large clusters, the partition distribution can be unbalanced because of the different startup time. You can check the machine distribution by using the following command.

```ngql
nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| Host      | Port  | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution | Partition distribution |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| storaged0 | 44500 | ONLINE | 1            | nba:5               | nba:5                  |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| storaged1 | 44500 | ONLINE | 2            | test:1, nba:5       | nba:5, test:1          |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
| storaged2 | 44500 | ONLINE | 1            | nba:5               | nba:5                  |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------------+------------------------+
```

To balance all the online machines, use the following command.

```ngql
nebula> BALANCE LEADER;
```

# DROP SPACE

```ngql
DROP SPACE [IF EXISTS] <graph_space_name>
```

The `DROP SPACE` statement deletes everything in the related graph space.

You must have the `DROP` privilege for the related graph space.(TODO: authentication doc)

You can use the `IF EXISTS` keywords when dropping spaces. These keywords automatically detects if the related graph space exists. If it exists, it is deleted. Otherwise, no graph space is deleted.

Other graph spaces stay unchanged.

The `DROP SPACE` statement does not immediately remove all the files and directories in the storage engine (and release disk space). The deletion depends on the implementation of different storage engines.

> **NOTE:** Be *very* careful with this statement.

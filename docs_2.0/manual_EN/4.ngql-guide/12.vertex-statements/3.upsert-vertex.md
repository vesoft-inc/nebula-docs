# UPSERT VERTEX

```nGQL
UPSERT VERTEX <vid> SET <update_columns> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]
```

- `vid` is the ID of the vertex to be updated.
- `update_columns` is the properties of the vertex to be updated. For example, `tag1.col1 = $^.tag2.col2 + 1` means to update `tag1.col1` to `tag2.col2+1`.

    > **NOTE:**  `$^` indicates the vertex to be updated.

- `condition` is some constraints. Only when the conditions are met, `UPSERT` is executed successfully. `condition` supports expression operations.
- `columns` is the columns to be returned, `YIELD` returns the latest updated values.

`UPSERT` is a combination of `UPDATE` and `INSERT`.  Use `UPSERT VERTEX` to update properties on a vertex if it exists or insert a new vertex if it does not exist. The `UPDATE VERTEX` statement only updates one tag of a vertex at a time.

The performance of `UPSERT` is much lower than that of `INSERT`. Because `UPSERT` is a read-modify-write serialization operation at the partition level.

>**DON'T:** use `UPSERT` for large concurrent write scenarios.

- If the vertex does not exist, a new vertex is created no matter whether the condition in the `WHEN` clause is met or not. The property columns not specified by the `SET` statement use the default values of the columns. If there are no default values, an error is returned.
- If the vertex exists and the `WHEN` condition is met, the vertex is updated.
- If the vertex exists and the `WHEN` condition is not met, Nebula Graph does nothing.

Consider the following example:

```ngql
nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player111":("Ben Simmons", 22); -- Insert a new vertex.
nebula> UPSERT VERTEX "player111" SET player.name = "Dwight Howard", player.age = $^.player.age + 11 WHEN $^.player.name == "Ben Simmons" AND $^.player.age > 20 YIELD $^.player.name AS Name, $^.player.age AS Age; -- Do an upsert operation on the vertex.

+-----------------+-----+
| Name            | Age |
+-----------------+-----+
| "Dwight Howard" | 33  |
+-----------------+-----+
```

```ngql
nebula> FETCH PROP ON * "player123"; -- An empty set is returned, indicating vertex "player123" does not exist.
Empty set (Time spent: 3.069/4.382 ms)
nebula> UPSERT VERTEX "player123" SET player.age = $^.player.age + 1;
```

If the vertex "player123" does not exist and the default value of age is `NULL`, the `player.age` of vertex "player123" is `NULL`. If `player.age` has a default value, the `player.age` of vertex "player123" is the default value plus one.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG person(followers int, age int DEFAULT 0); -- Create example tag person

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX "300" SET person.followers = $^.person.age + 1,  person.age = 8; -- the number of followers is 1, age is 8

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX "300" SET person.age = 8, person.followers = $^.person.age + 1; -- the number of followers is 9, age is 8
```

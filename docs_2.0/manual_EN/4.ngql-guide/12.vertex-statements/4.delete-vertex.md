# DELETE VERTEX

```nGQL
DELETE VERTEX <vid1>[, <vid2>...]
```

Use `DELETE VERTEX` to delete vertices and the related incoming and outgoing edges of the vertices. The `DELETE VERTEX` statement deletes one vertex or multiple vertices at a time.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> DELETE VERTEX "team1";
```

The preceding query deletes the vertex whose ID is "team1".

Nebula Graph traverses the incoming and outgoing edges related to the vertices and deletes them all. Then Nebula Graph deletes information related to the vertices. Atomic operation is not guaranteed during the entire process for now, so please retry when failure occurs.

# Logs

**Nebula Graph** uses [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) to print logs, uses [gflag](https://gflags.github.io/gflags/) to control the severity level of the log, and provides an HTTP interface to dynamically change the log level at runtime to facilitate tracking.

## Log Directory

The default log directory is `/usr/local/nebula/logs/`.

**Note:** If you deleted the log directory during runtime, the runtime log would not continue to be printed. However, this operation will not affect the services. Restart the services to recover the logs.

## Parameter Description

### Two most commonly used flags in glog

- minloglevel: The numbers of severity levels INFO(DEBUG), WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL are 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Usually specified as 0 in debug, 1 in production. If you set the minloglevel to 4, no logs are printed.
- v: The scale of v is 0-4. When the value is set to 0,  you can further set the severity level of the debug log. The larger the value, the more detailed the log.

### Configuration Files

The default severity level for the metad, graphd, and storaged logs can be found in the configuration files (usually in `/usr/local/nebula/etc/`).

## Check and Change the Severity Levels Dynamically

Check all the flag values (log values included) of the current gflags with the following command. `curl` is only available when the `local_config` parameter is set to `true`.

```bash
> curl ${ws_ip}:${ws_port}/get_flags
```

In the command:

- `ws_ip` is the IP address of the HTTP service , which can be found in the configuration files above. The default value is 127.0.0.1.
- `ws_port` is the port of the HTTP service, the default value for `metad` is 11000, `storaged` is 12000ï¼Œ and `graphd` is 13000.

For example, check the severity minloglevel of the `storaged` service:

```bash
> curl 127.0.0.1:12000/get_flags | grep minloglevel
```

You can also change the logs' severity level to **the most detailed** with the following command.

```bash
> curl "http://127.0.0.1:12000/set_flags?flag=v&value=4"
> curl "http://127.0.0.1:12000/set_flags?flag=minloglevel&value=0"
```

In the Nebula console, check the severity minloglevel of graphd and set it to **the most detailed** with the following commands.

```ngql
nebula> GET CONFIGS graph:minloglevel;
nebula> UPDATE CONFIGS graph:minloglevel=0;
```

To change the severity of the storage log, replace the `graph` in the preceding command with `storage`. Note that **Nebula Graph** only supports modifying the graph and storage log severity via console, meta log cannot be modified.

**Close** all logs print (FATAL only) with the following command.

```bash
> curl "http://127.0.0.1:12000/set_flags?flag=minloglevel&value=4"
```

# Deploying Cluster

In this document, we will walk you through the process of deploying a **Nebula Graph** cluster. At the same time, we have deployed a cluster with [Docker](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose) so that you can try it in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start deploying the **Nebula Graph** cluster, ensure that you have installed the latest **Nebula Graph** version on each host of your cluster. Installation method reference:

- [Installing With rpm](1.install-with-rpm-deb.md)
- [Building With Source Code](../1.build/1.build-source-code.md)

Because **Nebula Graph** have a lot of dependencies, we recommend installing with packages.

In this document, we prepared 3 machines with CentOS 7.5 system, the IPs are as follows:

```text
192.168.8.14 # cluster-14
192.168.8.15 # cluster-15
192.168.8.16 # cluster-16
```

## Services of Nebula Graph to Be Deployed

In this document, we are going to deploy the following services of **Nebula Graph**:

* 3 replicas of `nebula-metad` service
* 3 replicas of `nebula-storage`d service
* 1 replica of `nebula-graphd` service

```text
- cluster-14: metad/storaged/graphd
- cluster-15: metad/storaged
- cluster-16: metad/storaged
```

## Modifying the Configuration Files

All configuration files of **Nebula Graph** are located in the `/usr/local/nebula/etc` directory. **Nebula Graph** provides three default configurations.

### nebula-metad.conf

When deploying a cluster, you need to modify two parameters in the `nebula-metad.conf` file according to the services deployed on each node: `local_ip` and `meta_server_addrs`. `local_ip` needs to be changed to the node's IP, `meta_server_addrs` needs to be changed to ip:port of the meta service on the cluster. Multiple ip:port pairs need to be separated by commas.

Following is the two configuration on `cluster-14` :

```text
# Peers
--meta_server_addrs=192.168.8.14:45500,192.168.8.15:45500,192.168.8.16:45500
# Local ip
--local_ip=192.168.8.14
# Meta daemon listening port
--port=45500
```

### nebula-graphd.conf

When deploying a cluster, you need to configure the metad address and port `meta_server_addrs` for the graphd service. Following is part of the configuration on `cluster-14`:

```text
# Meta Server Address
--meta_server_addrs=192.168.8.14:45500,192.168.8.15:45500,192.168.8.16:45500
```

### nebula-storaged.conf

When deploying a cluster, you need to configure the metad address and port `meta_server_addrs` and the local address `local_ip` for the storaged service. Following is part of the configuration on `cluster-14`:

```text
# Meta server address
--meta_server_addrs=192.168.8.14:45500,192.168.8.15:45500,192.168.8.16:45500
# Local ip
--local_ip=192.168.8.14
# Storage daemon listening port
--port=44500
```

## Starting Your Cluster

Please refer to the [Start and stop Nebula Graph service documentation](2.start-stop-service.md) to start your cluster.

## Testing Your Cluster

Log in to one host in the cluster and execute the following command:

```ngql
[(none)]> SHOW HOSTS;
==================================================================================================
| Ip         | Port  | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution     | Partition distribution  |
==================================================================================================
| 192.168.8.14 | 44500 | online | 0            | No valid partition      | No valid partition      |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 192.168.8.15 | 44500 | online | 3            | toy: 1, test: 1, NBA: 1 | NBA: 1, toy: 1, test: 1 |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 192.168.8.16 | 44500 | online | 0            | No valid partition      | No valid partition      |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Total      |       |        | 3            | NBA: 1, toy: 1, test: 1 | NBA: 1, test: 1, toy: 1 |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

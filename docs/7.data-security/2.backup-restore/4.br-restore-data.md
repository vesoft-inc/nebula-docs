# Use BR to restore data

If you use the BR to back up data, you can use it to restore the data to Nebula Graph. This topic introduces how to use the BR to restore data from backup files.

!!! caution

    During the restoration process, the data on the target Nebula Graph cluster is removed and then is replaced with the data from the backup files. If necessary, back up the data on the target cluster.

!!! caution

    The restoration process is performed OFFLINE.

## Prerequisites

To restore data with the BR, do a check of these:

- The BR is compiled. For more information, see [Compile BR](2.compile-br.md).

- No application is connected to the target Nebula Graph cluster.

- Make sure that the target and the source Nebula Graph clusters have the same topology, which means that they have exactly the same number of hosts.

- Your account on the BR machine can log on to the meta and the storage servers via SSH without a password. For more information, see[SSH tunnels with keys](http://alexander.holbreich.org/ssh-tunnel-without-password/).

  !!! caution

        This account must have write privileges to the installation directory of Nebula Graph and the data directory (--data_path) of the meta/storage service.

- To perform the restoration process, a `root` user is required.

- If the backup files are stored on Alibaba Cloud OSS or Amazon S3, make sure that the S3 CLI client or ossutil is installed and configured on the meta servers, the storage servers, and the BR machine. For more information, see [Alibaba Cloud ossutil Documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/120075.htm#concept-303829) and [Amazon S3 CLI Documentation](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-s3.html).

  !!! caution

      Run `ln -s /<ossutil_tool_installation_path>/<ossutil64 or ossutil> /usr/local/bin/ossutil` to make the `ossutil` command effective.

## Procedures

1. Users can use the following command to list the existing backup information:

   ```bash
   $ ./bin/br show --storage <ip_address>
   ```
   For example, use the following command to list the backup information in the local `/home/test/backup` path.
   ```bash
   $ ./bin/br show --storage "local:///home/test/backup"
   +----------------------------+---------------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+
   |            NAME            |     CREATE TIME     |      SPACES      | FULL BACKUP | SPECIFY SPACE |
   +----------------------------+---------------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+
   | BACKUP_2021_07_29_06_51_09 | 2021-07-29 06:51:09 | basketballplayer | true        | true          |
   | BACKUP_2021_07_29_07_55_08 | 2021-07-29 07:55:09 | basketballplayer | true        | true          |
   +----------------------------+---------------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+
   ```

2. Run the following command to restore data.

   ```
   [root]# ./bin/br restore full --meta <ip_address> --storage <storage_path> --name <backup_name> --user <user_name>
   ```

   For example, use the following command to restore the data in the local `/home/foesa/backup` path to the cluster where the address is `192.168.*.*:9559` and the user name of the host where the meta/storage service is located is `root`.

   ```
   [root]# ./bin/br restore full --meta "192.168.*.*:9559" --storage "local:///home/test/backup" --name "BACKUP_2021_07_29_07_55_08" --user "root"
   ```

   If the following information is returned, the data is restored successfully.
   ```bash
   restore successed
   ```

   The parameters are as follows.

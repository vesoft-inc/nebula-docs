# Roles and privileges

A role is a collection of privileges. You can assign a role to a [user](2.management-user.md) for access control.

## Built-in roles

Nebula Graph does not support custom roles, but it has multiple built-in roles:

* GOD

  * GOD is the original role with **all privileges** not limited to graph spaces. It is similar to `root` in Linux and `administrator` in Windows.

  * When the Meta Service is initialized, the one and only GOD role user `root` is automatically created with the password `nebula`.

  !!! caution

      Modify the password for `root` timely for security.

  * One cluster can only have one user with the GOD role. This user can manage all graph spaces in a cluster.

  * Manual authorization of the God role is not supported. Only the `root` user with the default God role can be used.

* ADMIN

  * An ADMIN role can **read and write** both the Schema and the data in a specific graph space.

  * An ADMIN role of a graph space can grant DBA, USER, and GUEST roles in the graph space to other users.

    !!! note

        Only roles lower than ADMIN can be authorized to other users.

* DBA

  * A DBA role can **read and write** both the Schema and the data in a specific graph space.

  * A DBA role of a graph space CANNOT grant roles to other users.

* USER

  * A USER role can **read and write** data in a specific graph space.

  * The Schema information is **read-only** to the USER roles in a graph space.

* GUEST
  * A GUEST role can **only read** the Schema and the data in a specific graph space.

!!! note

    * Nebula Graph does not support custom roles. Users can only use the default built-in roles.
    * A user can have only one role in a graph space. For authenticated users, see [User management](2.management-user.md).

## Role privileges and allowed nGQL

The privileges of roles and the nGQL statements that each role can use are listed as follows.

!!! caution

    * The results of `SHOW` operations are limited to the role of a user. For example, all users can run `SHOW SPACES`, but the results only include the graph spaces that the users have privileges.
    * Only the GOD role can run `SHOW USERS` and `SHOW SNAPSHOTS`.

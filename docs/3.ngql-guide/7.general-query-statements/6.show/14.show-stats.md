# SHOW STATS

The `SHOW STATS` statement shows the statistics of the graph space collected by the latest `STATS` job.

The statistics include the following information:

* The number of vertices in the graph space
* The number of edges in the graph space
* The number of vertices of each tag
* The number of edges of each edge type

## Prerequisites

You have to run the `SUBMIT JOB STATS` statement in the graph space where you want to collect statistics. For more information, see [SUBMIT JOB STATS](../../18.operation-and-maintenance-statements/4.job-statements.md).

!!! caution

    The result of the `SHOW STATS` statement is based on the last executed `SUBMIT JOB STATS` statement. If you want to update the result, run `SUBMIT JOB STATS` again. Otherwise the statistics will be wrong.

## Syntax

```ngql
SHOW STATS;
```

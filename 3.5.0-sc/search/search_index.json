Obtain NebulaGraph Console \u00b6 You can obtain NebulaGraph Console in the following ways: Download the binary file from the GitHub releases page . Compile the source code to obtain the binary file. For more information, see Install from source code . NebulaGraph Console functions \u00b6 Connect to NebulaGraph \u00b6 To connect to NebulaGraph with the nebula-console file, use the following syntax: <path_of_console> -addr <ip> -port <port> -u <username> -p <password> path_of_console indicates the storage path of the NebulaGraph Console binary file. Parameter descriptions are as follows: Parameter Description -h/-help Shows the help menu. -addr/-address Sets the IP address of the Graph service. The default address is 127.0.0.1. -P/-port Sets the port number of the graphd service. The default port number is 9669. -u/-user Sets the username of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any existing username. The default username is root . -p/-password Sets the password of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the password. -t/-timeout Sets an integer-type timeout threshold of the connection. The unit is millisecond. The default value is 120. -e/-eval Sets a string-type nGQL statement. The nGQL statement is executed once the connection succeeds. The connection stops after the result is returned. -f/-file Sets the path of an nGQL file. The nGQL statements in the file are executed once the connection succeeds. The result will be returned and the connection stops then. -enable_ssl Enables SSL encryption when connecting to NebulaGraph. -ssl_root_ca_path Sets the storage path of the certification authority file. -ssl_cert_path Sets the storage path of the certificate file. -ssl_private_key_path Sets the storage path of the private key file. For information on more parameters, see the project repository . For example, to connect to the Graph Service deployed on 192.168.10.8, run the following command: ./nebula-console -addr 192 .168.10.8 -port 9669 -u root -p thisisapassword Manage parameters \u00b6 You can save parameters for parameterized queries. Note Setting a parameter as a VID in a query is not supported. Parameters are not supported in SAMPLE clauses. Parameters are deleted when their sessions are released. The command to save a parameter is as follows: nebula> :param <param_name> => <param_value>; The example is as follows: nebula> :param p1 => \"Tim Duncan\"; nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:$p1})-[:follow]->(n) RETURN v,n; +----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ | v | n | +----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | (\"player125\" :player{age: 41, name: \"Manu Ginobili\"}) | | (\"player100\" :player{age: 42, name: \"Tim Duncan\"}) | (\"player101\" :player{age: 36, name: \"Tony Parker\"}) | +----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+ nebula> :param p2 => {\"a\":3,\"b\":false,\"c\":\"Tim Duncan\"}; nebula> RETURN $p2.b AS b; +-------+ | b | +-------+ | false | +-------+ The command to view the saved parameters is as follows: nebula> :params; The command to view the specified parameters is as follows: nebula> :params <param_name>; The command to delete a specified parameter is as follows: nebula> :param <param_name> =>; Export query results \u00b6 Export query results, which can be saved as a CSV file, DOT file, and a format of Profile or Explain. Note The exported file is stored in the working directory, i.e., what the linux command pwd shows. This command only works for the next query statement. You can copy the contents of the DOT file and paste them in GraphvizOnline to generate a visualized execution plan. The command to export a csv file is as follows: nebula> :CSV <file_name.csv>; The command to export a DOT file is as follows: nebula> :dot <file_name.dot> The example is as follows: nebula> :dot a.dot nebula> PROFILE FORMAT=\"dot\" GO FROM \"player100\" OVER follow; The command to export a PROFILE or EXPLAIN format is as follows: nebula> :profile <file_name>; or nebula> :explain <file_name>; Note The text file output by the above command is the preferred way to report issues in GitHub and execution plans in forums, and for graph query tuning because it has more information and is more readable than a screenshot or CSV file in Studio. The example is as follows: nebula> :profile profile.log nebula> PROFILE GO FROM \"player102\" OVER serve YIELD dst(edge); nebula> :profile profile.dot nebula> PROFILE FORMAT=\"dot\" GO FROM \"player102\" OVER serve YIELD dst(edge); nebula> :explain explain.log nebula> EXPLAIN GO FROM \"player102\" OVER serve YIELD dst(edge); Import a testing dataset \u00b6 The testing dataset is named basketballplayer . To view details about the schema and data, use the corresponding SHOW command.

What exactly is a graph database? What can it do? Where does it fit in the database landscape? To answer these questions, we first need to understand graphs. Graphs are one of the main areas of research in computer science. Graphs can efficiently solve many of the problems that exist today. This topic will start with graphs and explain the advantages of graph databases and their great potential in modern application development, and then describe the differences between distributed graph databases and several other types of databases. What are graphs? \u00b6 Graphs are everywhere. When hearing the word graph, many people think of bar charts or line charts, because sometimes we call them graphs, which show the connections between two or more data systems. The simplest example is the following picture, which shows the number of NebulaGraph GitHub repository stars over time. This type of diagram is often called a line chart. As you can see, the number of starts rises over time. A line chart can show data changes over time (depending on the scale settings). Here we have given only examples of line charts. There are various graphs, such as pie charts, bar charts, etc. Another kind of diagram is often used in daily conversation, such as image recognition, retouched photos. This type of diagram is called a picture/photo/image. The diagram we discuss in this topic is a different concept, the graph in graph theory. In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, graphs are used to represent the relationships between entities. A graph consists of several small dots (called vertices or nodes) and lines or curves (called edges) that connect these dots. The term graph was proposed by Sylvester in 1878. The following picture is what this topic calls a graph. Simply put, graph theory is the study of graphs. Graph theory began in the early 18th century with the problem of the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg. K\u00f6nigsberg was then a Prussian city (now part of Russia, renamed Kaliningrad). The river Preger crossed K\u00f6nigsberg and not only divided K\u00f6nigsberg into two parts, but also formed two small islands in the middle of the river. This divided the city into four areas, each connected by seven bridges. There was a game associated with K\u00f6nigsberg at the time, namely how to cross each bridge only once and navigate the entire four areas of the city. A simplified view of the seven bridges is shown below. Try to find the answer to this game if you are interested 1 . To solve this problem, the great mathematician Euler proved that the problem was unsolvable by abstracting the four regions of the city into points and the seven bridges connecting the city into edges connecting the points. The simplified abstract diagram is as follows 2 . The four dots in the picture represent the four regions of K\u00f6nigsberg, and the lines between the dots represent the seven bridges connecting the four regions. It is easy to see that the area connected by the even-numbered bridges can be easily passed because different routes can be chosen to come and go. The areas connected by the odd-numbered bridges can only be used as starting or endings points because the same route can only be taken once. The number of edges associated with a node is called the node degree. Now it can be shown that the K\u00f6nigsberg problem can only be solved if two nodes have odd degrees and the other nodes have even degrees, i.e., two regions must have an even number of bridges and the remaining regions have an odd number of bridges. However, as we know from the above picture, there is no even number of bridges in any region of K\u00f6nigsberg, so this puzzle is unsolvable. Property graphs \u00b6 From a mathematical point of view, graph theory studies the relationships between modeled objects. However, it is common to extend the underlying graph model. The extended graphs are called the attribute graph model . A property graph usually consists of the following components. Node, an object or entity. In this topic, nodes are called vertices. Relationship between nodes. In this topic, relationships are called edges. Usually, the edges can be directed or undirected to indicate a relationship between two entities. There can be properties on nodes and edges. In real life, there are many examples of property graphs. For example, Qichacha or BOSS Zhipin use graphs to model business equity relationships. A vertex usually represents a natural person or a business, and the edge represents the equity relationship between a person and a business. The properties on vertices can be the name, age, ID number, etc. of the natural person. The properties on edges can be the investment amount, investment time, position such as director and supervisor. A vertex can be a listed company and an edge can be a correlation between listed companies. The vertex property can be a stock code, abbreviation, market capitalization, sector, etc. The edge property can be the time-series correlation coefficient of the stock price 3 . The graph relationship can also be similar to the character relationship in a TV series like Game of Thrones 4 . Vertices stand for the characters. Edges represent the interactions between the characters. Vertex properties are the character's names, ages, camps, etc., and edge properties are the number of interactions between two characters. Graphs are also used for governance within IT systems. For example, a company like WeBank has a very large data warehouse and corresponding data warehouse management tools. These management tools record the ETL relationships between the Hive tables in the data warehouse through Job implementation 5 . Such ETL relationships can be very easily presented and managed in the form of graphs, and the root cause can be easily traced when problems arise. Graphs can also be used to document the invocation relationships between the intricate microservices within a large IT system 6 , which is used by operations teams for service governance. Here each point represents a microservice and the edge represents the invocation relationship between two microservices; thus, Ops can easily find invocation links with availability below a threshold (99.99%) or discover microservice nodes that would be particularly affected by a failure. Graphs are also used to record the invocation relationships between the intricate microservices 6 . Each vertex represents a microservice and an edge represents the invocation relationship between two microservices. This allows Ops to easily find call links with availability below a threshold (99.99%), or to discover microservice nodes where a failure would have a particularly large impact. Graphs can also be used to improve the efficiency of code development. Graphs store function call relationships between codes 6 to improve the efficiency of reviewing and testing the code. In such a graph, each vertex is a function or variable, each edge is a call relationship between functions or variables. When there is a new code commit, one can more easily see other interfaces that may be affected, which helps testers better assess potential go-live risks. In addition, we can discover more scenarios by adding some temporal information as opposed to a static property graph that does not change. For example, inside a network of interbank account fund flows 7 , a vertex is an account, an edge is the transfer record between accounts. Edge properties record the time, amount, etc. of the transfer. Companies can use graph technology to easily explore the graph to discover obvious misappropriation of funds, paying back a load to with the loan, loan gang scams, and other phenomena. The same approach can be used to explore the discovery of the flow of cryptocurrencies. In a network of accounts and devices 8 , vertices can be accounts, mobile devices, and WIFI networks, edges are the login relationships between these accounts and mobile devices, and the access relationships between mobile devices and WIFI networks. These graph data records the characteristic of the network black production operations. Some big companies such as 360 DigiTech 8 , Kuaishou 9 , WeChat 10 , Zhihu 11 , and Ctrip Finance all identified over a million crime groups through technology. In addition to the dimension of time, you can find more scenarios for property graphs by adding some geographic location information. For an example of tracing the source of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) 12 , vertices are the person and edges are the contact between people. Vertex properties are the information of the person's ID card and onset time, and edge properties are the time and geographical location of the close contact between people, etc. It provides help for health prevention departments to quickly identify high-risk people and their behavioral trajectories. The combination of geographic location and graph is also used in some O2O scenarios, such as real-time food recommendation based on POI (Point-of-Interest) 13 , which enables local life service platform companies like Meituan to recommend more suitable businesses in real-time when consumers open the APP. A graph is also used for knowledge inference. Huawei, Vivo, OPPO, WeChat, Meituan, and other companies use graphs for the representation of the underlying knowledge relationships. Why do we use graph databases? \u00b6 Although relational databases and semi-structured databases such as XML/JSON can be used to describe a graph-structured data model, a graph (database) not only describes the graph structure and stores data itself but also focuses on handling the associative relationships between the data. Specifically, graph databases have several advantages: Graphs are a more visual and intuitive way of representing knowledge to human brains. This allows us to focus on the business problem itself rather than how to describe the problem as a particular structure of the database (e.g., a table structure). It is easier to show the characteristic of the data in graphs. Such as transfer paths and nearby communities. To analyze the relationships of characters and character importance in Game of Thrones, data displayed with tables is not as intuitive as with graphs. Especially when some central vertices are deleted: Adding an edge can completely change the entire topology. We can intuitively sense the importance of minor changes in graphs rather than in tables. Graph query language is designed based on graph structures. The following is a query example in LDBC. Requirements: Query the posts posted by a person, and query the corresponding replies (the replies themselves will also be replied multiple times). Since the posting time and reply time both meet certain conditions, you can sort the results according to the number of replies. Write querying statements using PostgreSQL: --PostgreSQL WITH RECURSIVE post_all ( psa_threadid , psa_thread_creatorid , psa_messageid , psa_creationdate , psa_messagetype ) AS ( SELECT m_messageid AS psa_threadid , m_creatorid AS psa_thread_creatorid , m_messageid AS psa_messageid , m_creationdate , 'Post' FROM message WHERE 1 = 1 AND m_c_replyof IS NULL -- post, not comment AND m_creationdate BETWEEN : startDate AND : endDate UNION ALL SELECT psa . psa_threadid AS psa_threadid , psa . psa_thread_creatorid AS psa_thread_creatorid , m_messageid , m_creationdate , 'Comment' FROM message p , post_all psa WHERE 1 = 1 AND p . m_c_replyof = psa . psa_messageid AND m_creationdate BETWEEN : startDate AND : endDate ) SELECT p . p_personid AS \"person.id\" , p . p_firstname AS \"person.firstName\" , p . p_lastname AS \"person.lastName\" , count ( DISTINCT psa . psa_threadid ) AS threadCount END ) AS messageCount , count ( DISTINCT psa . psa_messageid ) AS messageCount FROM person p left join post_all psa on ( 1 = 1 AND p . p_personid = psa . psa_thread_creatorid AND psa_creationdate BETWEEN : startDate AND : endDate ) GROUP BY p . p_personid , p . p_firstname , p . p_lastname ORDER BY messageCount DESC , p . p_personid LIMIT 100 ; Write querying statements using Cypher designed especially for graphs: -- Cypher MATCH ( person : Person ) <-[ : HAS_CREATOR ]- ( post : Post ) <-[ : REPLY_OF * 0 .. ]- ( reply : Message ) WHERE post . creationDate >= $ startDate AND post . creationDate <= $ endDate AND reply . creationDate >= $ startDate AND reply . creationDate <= $ endDate RETURN person . id , person . firstName , person . lastName , count ( DISTINCT post ) AS threadCount , count ( DISTINCT reply ) AS messageCount ORDER BY messageCount DESC , person . id ASC LIMIT 100 Graph traversal (corresponding to Join in SQL) is much more efficient because the storage and query engines are designed specifically for the structure of the graph. Graph databases have a wide range of application scenarios. Examples include data integration (knowledge graph), personalized recommendations, fraud, and threat detection, risk analysis, and compliance, identity (and control) verification, IT infrastructure management, supply chain, and logistics, social network research, etc. According to the literature 14 , the fields that use graph technology are (from the greatest to least): information technology (IT), research in academia, finance, laboratories in industry, government, healthcare, defense, pharmaceuticals, retail, and e-commerce, transportation, telecommunications, and insurance. In 2019, according to Gartner's questionnaire research, 27% of customers (500 groups) are using graph databases and 20% have plans to use them.

Now it can be shown that the K\u00f6nigsberg problem can only be solved if two nodes have odd degrees and the other nodes have even degrees, i.e., two regions must have an even number of bridges and the remaining regions have an odd number of bridges. However, as we know from the above picture, there is no even number of bridges in any region of K\u00f6nigsberg, so this puzzle is unsolvable.","title":"What are graphs?"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-0-graph/#property_graphs","text":"From a mathematical point of view, graph theory studies the relationships between modeled objects. However, it is common to extend the underlying graph model. The extended graphs are called the attribute graph model . A property graph usually consists of the following components. Node, an object or entity. In this topic, nodes are called vertices. Relationship between nodes. In this topic, relationships are called edges. Usually, the edges can be directed or undirected to indicate a relationship between two entities. There can be properties on nodes and edges. In real life, there are many examples of property graphs. For example, Qichacha or BOSS Zhipin use graphs to model business equity relationships. A vertex usually represents a natural person or a business, and the edge represents the equity relationship between a person and a business. The properties on vertices can be the name, age, ID number, etc. of the natural person. The properties on edges can be the investment amount, investment time, position such as director and supervisor. A vertex can be a listed company and an edge can be a correlation between listed companies. The vertex property can be a stock code, abbreviation, market capitalization, sector, etc. The edge property can be the time-series correlation coefficient of the stock price 3 . The graph relationship can also be similar to the character relationship in a TV series like Game of Thrones 4 . Vertices stand for the characters. Edges represent the interactions between the characters. Vertex properties are the character's names, ages, camps, etc., and edge properties are the number of interactions between two characters. Graphs are also used for governance within IT systems. For example, a company like WeBank has a very large data warehouse and corresponding data warehouse management tools. These management tools record the ETL relationships between the Hive tables in the data warehouse through Job implementation 5 . Such ETL relationships can be very easily presented and managed in the form of graphs, and the root cause can be easily traced when problems arise. Graphs can also be used to document the invocation relationships between the intricate microservices within a large IT system 6 , which is used by operations teams for service governance. Here each point represents a microservice and the edge represents the invocation relationship between two microservices; thus, Ops can easily find invocation links with availability below a threshold (99.99%) or discover microservice nodes that would be particularly affected by a failure. Graphs are also used to record the invocation relationships between the intricate microservices 6 . Each vertex represents a microservice and an edge represents the invocation relationship between two microservices. This allows Ops to easily find call links with availability below a threshold (99.99%), or to discover microservice nodes where a failure would have a particularly large impact. Graphs can also be used to improve the efficiency of code development. Graphs store function call relationships between codes 6 to improve the efficiency of reviewing and testing the code. In such a graph, each vertex is a function or variable, each edge is a call relationship between functions or variables. When there is a new code commit, one can more easily see other interfaces that may be affected, which helps testers better assess potential go-live risks. In addition, we can discover more scenarios by adding some temporal information as opposed to a static property graph that does not change. For example, inside a network of interbank account fund flows 7 , a vertex is an account, an edge is the transfer record between accounts. Edge properties record the time, amount, etc. of the transfer. Companies can use graph technology to easily explore the graph to discover obvious misappropriation of funds, paying back a load to with the loan, loan gang scams, and other phenomena. The same approach can be used to explore the discovery of the flow of cryptocurrencies. In a network of accounts and devices 8 , vertices can be accounts, mobile devices, and WIFI networks, edges are the login relationships between these accounts and mobile devices, and the access relationships between mobile devices and WIFI networks. These graph data records the characteristic of the network black production operations. Some big companies such as 360 DigiTech 8 , Kuaishou 9 , WeChat 10 , Zhihu 11 , and Ctrip Finance all identified over a million crime groups through technology. In addition to the dimension of time, you can find more scenarios for property graphs by adding some geographic location information. For an example of tracing the source of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) 12 , vertices are the person and edges are the contact between people. Vertex properties are the information of the person's ID card and onset time, and edge properties are the time and geographical location of the close contact between people, etc. It provides help for health prevention departments to quickly identify high-risk people and their behavioral trajectories. The combination of geographic location and graph is also used in some O2O scenarios, such as real-time food recommendation based on POI (Point-of-Interest) 13 , which enables local life service platform companies like Meituan to recommend more suitable businesses in real-time when consumers open the APP. A graph is also used for knowledge inference. Huawei, Vivo, OPPO, WeChat, Meituan, and other companies use graphs for the representation of the underlying knowledge relationships.","title":"Property graphs"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-0-graph/#why_do_we_use_graph_databases","text":"Although relational databases and semi-structured databases such as XML/JSON can be used to describe a graph-structured data model, a graph (database) not only describes the graph structure and stores data itself but also focuses on handling the associative relationships between the data. Specifically, graph databases have several advantages: Graphs are a more visual and intuitive way of representing knowledge to human brains. This allows us to focus on the business problem itself rather than how to describe the problem as a particular structure of the database (e.g., a table structure). It is easier to show the characteristic of the data in graphs. Such as transfer paths and nearby communities. To analyze the relationships of characters and character importance in Game of Thrones, data displayed with tables is not as intuitive as with graphs. Especially when some central vertices are deleted: Adding an edge can completely change the entire topology. We can intuitively sense the importance of minor changes in graphs rather than in tables. Graph query language is designed based on graph structures. The following is a query example in LDBC. Requirements: Query the posts posted by a person, and query the corresponding replies (the replies themselves will also be replied multiple times). Since the posting time and reply time both meet certain conditions, you can sort the results according to the number of replies. Write querying statements using PostgreSQL: --PostgreSQL WITH RECURSIVE post_all ( psa_threadid , psa_thread_creatorid , psa_messageid , psa_creationdate , psa_messagetype ) AS ( SELECT m_messageid AS psa_threadid , m_creatorid AS psa_thread_creatorid , m_messageid AS psa_messageid , m_creationdate , 'Post' FROM message WHERE 1 = 1 AND m_c_replyof IS NULL -- post, not comment AND m_creationdate BETWEEN : startDate AND : endDate UNION ALL SELECT psa . psa_threadid AS psa_threadid , psa . psa_thread_creatorid AS psa_thread_creatorid , m_messageid , m_creationdate , 'Comment' FROM message p , post_all psa WHERE 1 = 1 AND p . m_c_replyof = psa . psa_messageid AND m_creationdate BETWEEN : startDate AND : endDate ) SELECT p . p_personid AS \"person.id\" , p . p_firstname AS \"person.firstName\" , p . p_lastname AS \"person.lastName\" , count ( DISTINCT psa . psa_threadid ) AS threadCount END ) AS messageCount , count ( DISTINCT psa . psa_messageid ) AS messageCount FROM person p left join post_all psa on ( 1 = 1 AND p . p_personid = psa . psa_thread_creatorid AND psa_creationdate BETWEEN : startDate AND : endDate ) GROUP BY p . p_personid , p . p_firstname , p . p_lastname ORDER BY messageCount DESC , p . p_personid LIMIT 100 ; Write querying statements using Cypher designed especially for graphs: -- Cypher MATCH ( person : Person ) <-[ : HAS_CREATOR ]- ( post : Post ) <-[ : REPLY_OF * 0 .. ]- ( reply : Message ) WHERE post . creationDate >= $ startDate AND post . creationDate <= $ endDate AND reply . creationDate >= $ startDate AND reply . creationDate <= $ endDate RETURN person . id , person . firstName , person . lastName , count ( DISTINCT post ) AS threadCount , count ( DISTINCT reply ) AS messageCount ORDER BY messageCount DESC , person . id ASC LIMIT 100 Graph traversal (corresponding to Join in SQL) is much more efficient because the storage and query engines are designed specifically for the structure of the graph. Graph databases have a wide range of application scenarios. Examples include data integration (knowledge graph), personalized recommendations, fraud, and threat detection, risk analysis, and compliance, identity (and control) verification, IT infrastructure management, supply chain, and logistics, social network research, etc. According to the literature 14 , the fields that use graph technology are (from the greatest to least): information technology (IT), research in academia, finance, laboratories in industry, government, healthcare, defense, pharmaceuticals, retail, and e-commerce, transportation, telecommunications, and insurance. In 2019, according to Gartner's questionnaire research, 27% of customers (500 groups) are using graph databases and 20% have plans to use them.","title":"Why do we use graph databases?"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-0-graph/#rdf","text":"This topic does not discuss the RDF data model due to space limitations.

Different graph databases may differ slightly in terms of terminology, but in the end, they all talk about vertices, edges, and properties. As for more advanced features such as labels, indexes, constraints, TTL, long tasks, stored procedures, and UDFs, these advanced features will vary significantly from one graph database to another. Graph databases use graphs to store data, and the graph structure is one of the structures that are closest to high flexibility and high performance. A graph database is a storage engine specifically designed to store and retrieve large information, which efficiently stores data as vertices and edges and allows high-performance retrieval and querying of these vertex-edge structures. We can also add properties to these vertices and edges. Third-party services market predictions \u00b6 DB-Engines ranking \u00b6 According to DB-Engines.com, the world's leading database ranking site, graph databases have been the fastest growing database category since 2013 1 . The site counts trends in the popularity of each category based on several metrics, including records and trends based on search engines such as Google, technical topics discussed on major IT technology forums and social networking sites, job posting changes on job boards. 371 database products are included in the site and are divided into 12 categories. Of these 12 categories, a category like graph databases is growing much faster than any of the others. Gartner\u2019s predictions \u00b6 Gartner, one of the world's top think tanks, identified graph databases as a major business intelligence and analytics technology trend long before 2013 2 . At that time, big data was hot as ever, and data scientists were in a hot position. Until recently, graph databases and related graph technologies were ranked in the Top 10 Data and Analytics Trends for 2021 3 . Trend 8: Graph Relates Everything Graphs form the foundation of many modern data and analytics capabilities to find relationships between people, places, things, events, and locations across diverse data assets. D&A leaders rely on graphs to quickly answer complex business questions which require contextual awareness and an understanding of the nature of connections and strengths across multiple entities. Gartner predicts that by 2025, graph technologies will be used in 80% of data and analytics innovations, up from 10% in 2021, facilitating rapid decision-making across the organization. It can be noted that Gartner's predictions match the DB-Engines ranking well. There is usually a period of rapid bubble development, then a plateau period, followed by a new bubble period due to the emergence of new technologies, and then a plateau period again. Market size of graph databases \u00b6 According to statistics and forecasts from Verifiedmarketresearc 4 , fnfresearch 5 , MarketsandMarkets 6 , and Gartner 7 , the global graph database market size is about to grow from about USD 0.8 billion in 2019 to USD 3-4 billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 25%, which corresponds to about 5%-10% market share of the global database market. Market participants \u00b6 Neo4j, the pioneer of (first generation) graph databases \u00b6 Although some graph-like data models and products, and the corresponding graph language G/G+ had been proposed in the 1970s (e.g. CODASYL 8 ). But it is Neo4j, the main pioneer in this market, that has really made the concept of graph databases popular, and even the two main terms (labeled) property graphs and graph databases were first introduced and practiced by Neo4j. !!! Info \"This section on the history of Neo4j and the graph query language it created, Cypher, is largely excerpted from the ISO WG3 paper An overview of the recent history of Graph Query Languages 10 and 9 . To take into account the latest two years of development, the content mentioned in this topic has been abridged and updated by the authors of this book. About GQL (Graph Query Language) and the development of an International Standard Readers familiar with databases are probably aware of the Structured Query Language SQL. by using SQL, people access databases in a way that is close to natural language. Before SQL was widely adopted and standardized, the market for relational databases was very fragmented. Each vendor's product had a completely different way of accessing. Developers of the database product itself, developers of the tools surrounding the database product, and end-users of the database, all had to learn each product. When the SQL-89 standard was developed in 1989, the entire relational database market quickly focus on SQL-89. This greatly reduced the learning costs for the people mentioned above. GQL (Graph Query Language) assumes a role similar to SQL in the field of graph databases. Uses interacts with graphs with GQL. Unlike international standards such as SQL-89, there are no international standards for GQL. Two mainstream graph languages are Neo4j\u2019s Cypher and Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin. The former is often referred to as the DQL, Declarative Query Language. DQL tells the system \"what to do\", regardless of \"how to do\". The latter is referred to as the IQL, Imperative Query Language. IQL explicitly specifies the system's actions. The GQL International Standard is in the process of being developed. Overview of the recent history of graph databases \u00b6 In 2000, the idea of modeling data as a network came to the founders of Neo4j. In 2001, Neo4j developed the earliest core part of the code. In 2007, Neo4j started operating as a company. In 2009, Neo4j borrowed XPath as a graph query language. Gremlin 11 is also similar to XPath. In 2010, Marko Rodriguez, a Neo4j employee, used the term Property Graph to describe the data model of Neo4j and TinkerPop (Gremlin). In 2011, the first public version Neo4j 1.4 was released, and the first version of Cypher was released. In 2012, Neo4j 1.8 enabled you to write a Cypher. Neo4j 2.0 added labels and indexes. Cypher became a declarative graph query language. In 2015, Cypher was opened up by Neo4j through the openCypher project. In 2017, the ISO WG3 organization discussed how to use SQL to query property graph data. In 2018, Starting from the Neo4j 3.5 GA, the core of Neo4j only for the Enterprise Edition will no longer be open source. In 2019, ISO officially established two projects ISO/IEC JTC 1 N 14279 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32 N 3228 to develop an international standard for graph database language. In 2021, the $325 million Series F funding round for Neo4j marks the largest investment round in database history. The early history of Neo4j \u00b6 The data model property graph was first conceived in 2000. The founders of Neo4j were developing a media management system, and the schema of the system was often changed. To adapt to such changes, Peter Neubauer, one of the founders, wanted to enable the system to be modeled to a conceptually interconnected network. A group of graduate students at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay implemented the earliest prototypes. Emil Eifr\u00e9m, the Neo4j co-founder, and these students spent a week extending Peter's idea into a more abstract model: vertices were connected by relationships, and key-values were used as properties of vertices and relationships. They developed a Java API to interact with this data model and implemented an abstraction layer on top of the relational database. Although this network model greatly improved productivity, its performance has been poor. So Johan Svensson, Neo4j co-founder, put a lot of effort into implementing a native data management system, that is Neo4j. For the first few years, Neo4j was successful as an in-house product. In 2007, the intellectual property of Neo4j was transferred to an independent database company. In the first public release of Neo4j ( Neo4j 1.4, 2011), the data model was consisted of vertices and typed edges. Vertices and edges have properties. The early versions of Neo4j did not have indexes. Applications had to construct their search structure from the root vertex. Because this was very unwieldy for the applications, Neo4j 2.0 (2013.12) introduced a new concept label on vertices. Based on labels, Neo4j can index some predefined vertex properties. \"Vertex\", \"Relationship\", \"Property\", \"Relationships can only have one label.\", \"Vertices can have zero or multiple labels.\". All these concepts form the data model definitions for Neo4j property graphs. With the later addition of indexing, Cypher became the main way of interacting with Neo4j. This is because the application developer only needs to focus on the data itself, not on the search structure that the developer built himself as mentioned above. The creation of Gremlin \u00b6 Gremlin is a graph query language based on Apache TinkerPop, which is close in style to a sequence of function (procedure) calls. Initially, Neo4j was queried through the Java API. applications could embed the query engine as a library into the application and then use the API to query the graph. The early Neo4j employees Tobias Lindaaker, Ivarsson, Peter Neubauer, and Marko Rodriguez used XPath as a graph query. Groovy provides loop structures, branching, and computation. This was the original prototype of Gremlin, the first version of which was released in November 2009. Later, Marko found a lot of problems with using two different parsers (XPath and Groovy) at the same time and changed Gremlin to a Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on Groovy. The creation of Cypher \u00b6 Gremlin, like Neo4j's Java API, was originally intended to be a procedural way of expressing how to query databases. It uses shorter syntaxes to query and remotely access databases through the network. The procedural nature of Gremlin requires users to know the best way to query results, which is still burdensome for application developers. Over the last 30 years, the declarative language SQL has been a great success. SQL can separate the declarative way to get data from how the engine gets data. So the Neo4j engineers wanted to develop a declarative graph query language. In 2010, Andr\u00e9s Taylor joined Neo4j as an engineer. Inspired by SQL, he started a project to develop graph query language, which was released as Neo4j 1.4 in 2011. The language is the ancestor of most graph query languages today - Cypher. Cypher's syntax is based on the use of ASCII art to describe graph patterns. This approach originally came from the annotations on how to describe graph patterns in the source code. An example can be seen as follows. Simply put, ASCII art uses printable text to describe vertices and edges. Cypher syntax uses () for vertices and -[]-> for edges. (query)-[modeled as]->(drawing) is used to represent a simple graph relationship (which can also be called graph schema): the starting vertex - query , the destination vertex - drawing , and the edge - modeled as . The first version of Cypher implemented graph reading, but users should specify vertices from which to start querying. Only from these vertices could graph schema matching be supported. In a later version, Neo4j 1.8, released in October 2012, Cypher added the ability to modify graphs. However, queries still need to specify which nodes to start from. In December 2013, Neo4j 2.0 introduced the concept of a label, which is essentially an index. This allows the query engine to use the index to select the vertices matched by the schema, without requiring the user to specify the vertex to start the query. With the popularity of Neo4j, Cypher has a wide community of developers and is widely used in a variety of industries. It is still the most popular graph query language. In September 2015, Neo4j established the openCypher Implementors Group (oCIG) to open source Cypher to openCypher, to govern and advance the evolution of the language itself through open source. Subsequent events \u00b6 Cypher has inspired a series of graph query languages, including: 2015, Oracle released PGQL, a graph language used by the graph engine PGX. 2016, the Linked Data Benchmarking Council (short for LDBC) an industry-renowned benchmarking organization for graph performance, released G-CORE. 2018, RedisGraph, a Redis-based graph library, adopted Cypher as its graph language. 2019, the International Standards Organization ISO started two projects to initiate the process of developing an international standard for graph languages based on existing industry achievements such as openCypher, PGQL, GSQL 12 , and G-CORE. 2019, NebulaGraph released NebulaGraph Query Language (nGQL) based on openCypher. Distributed graph databases \u00b6 From 2005 to 2010, with the release of Google's cloud computing \"Troika\", various distributed architectures became increasingly popular, including Hadoop and Cassandra, which have been open-sourced. Several implications are as follows: The technical and cost advantages of distributed systems over single machines (e.g. Neo4j) or small machines are more obvious due to the increasing volume of data and computation. Distributed systems allow applications to access these thousands of machines as if they were local systems, without the need for much modification at the code level. The open-source approach allows more people to know emerging technologies and feedback to the community in a more cost-effective way, including code developers, data scientists, and product managers. Strictly speaking, Neo4j also offers several distributed capabilities, which are quite different from the industry's sense of the distributed system. Neo4j 3. x requires that the full amount of data must be stored on a single machine. Although it supports full replication and high availability between multiple machines, the data cannot be sliced into different subgraphs. Neo4j 4. x stores a part of data on different machines (subgraphs), and then the application layer assembles data in a certain way (called Fabric) 13 and distributes the reads and writes to each machine. This approach requires a log of involvement and work from the application layer code. For example, designing how to place different subgraphs on which machines they should be placed and how to assemble some of the results obtained from each machine into the final result. The style of its syntax is as follows: USE graphA MATCH ( movie : Movie ) Return movie . title AS title UNION USE graphB MATCH ( move : Movie ) RETURN movie . title AS title The second generation (distributed) graph database: Titan and its successor JanusGraph \u00b6 In 2011, Aurelius was founded to develop an open-source distributed graph database called Titan 14 . By the first official release of Titan in 2015, the backend of Titan can support many major distributed storage architectures (e.g. Cassandra, HBase, Elasticsearch, BerkeleyDB) and can reuse many of the conveniences of the Hadoop ecosystem, with Gremlin as a unified query language on the frontend. It is easy for programmers to use, develop and participate in the community. Large-scale graphs could be sharded and stored on HBase or Cassandra (which were relatively mature distributed storage solutions at the time), and the Gremlin language was relatively full-featured though slightly lengthy. The whole solution was competitive at that time (2011-2015). The following picture shows the growth of Titan and Neo4j stars on Github.com from 2012 to 2015. After Aurelius (Titan) was acquired by DataStax in 2015, Titan was gradually transformed into a closed-source commercial product(DataStax Enterprise Graph). After the acquisition of Aurelius(Titan), there has been a strong demand for an open-source distributed graph database, and there were not many mature and active products in the market. In the era of big data, data is still being generated in a steady stream, far faster than Moore's Law. The Linux Foundation, along with some technology giants (Expero, Google, GRAKN.AI, Hortonworks, IBM, and Amazon) replicated and forked the original Titan project and started it as a new project JanusGraph 15 . Most of the community work including development, testing, release, and promotion, has been gradually shifted to the new JanusGraph. The following graph shows the evolution of daily code commits (pull requests) for the two projects, and we can see: Although Aurelius(Titan) still has some activity in its open-source code after its acquisition in 2015, the growth rate has slowed down significantly. This reflects the strength of the community. After the new project was started in January 2017, its community became active quickly, surpassing the number of pull requests accumulated by Titan in the past 5 years in just one year. At the same time, the open-source Titan came to a halt. Famous products of the same period OrientDB, TigerGraph, ArangoDB, and DGraph \u00b6 In addition to JanusGraph managed by the Linux Foundation, more vendors have been joined the overall market. Some distributed graph databases that were developed by commercial companies use different data models and access methods. The following table only lists the main differences. Vendors Creation time Core product Open source protocol Data model Query language OrientDB LTD (Acquired by SAP in 2017) 2011 OrientDB Open source Document + KV + Graph OrientDB SQL (SQL-based extended graph abilities) GraphSQL (was renamed TigerGraph) 2012 TigerGraph Commercial version Graph (Analysis) GraphSQL (similar to SQL) ArangoDB GmbH 2014 ArangoDB Apache License 2.0 Document + KV + Graph AQL (Simultaneous operation of documents, KVs and graphs) DGraph Labs 2016 DGraph Apache Public License 2.0 + Dgraph Community License Originally RDF, later changed to GraphQL GraphQL+- Traditional giants Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle \u00b6 In addition to vendors focused on graph products, traditional giants have also entered the graph database field. Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB 16 is a multimodal database cloud service on the Microsoft cloud that provides SQL, document, graph, key-value, and other capabilities. Amazon AWS Neptune 17 is a graph database cloud service provided by AWS support property graphs and RDF two data models. Oracle Graph 18 is a product of the relational database giant Oracle in the direction of graph technology and graph databases.

We can also add properties to these vertices and edges.","title":"Market overview of graph databases"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#third-party_services_market_predictions","text":"","title":"Third-party services market predictions"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#db-engines_ranking","text":"According to DB-Engines.com, the world's leading database ranking site, graph databases have been the fastest growing database category since 2013 1 .

But it is Neo4j, the main pioneer in this market, that has really made the concept of graph databases popular, and even the two main terms (labeled) property graphs and graph databases were first introduced and practiced by Neo4j. !!! Info \"This section on the history of Neo4j and the graph query language it created, Cypher, is largely excerpted from the ISO WG3 paper An overview of the recent history of Graph Query Languages 10 and 9 . To take into account the latest two years of development, the content mentioned in this topic has been abridged and updated by the authors of this book. About GQL (Graph Query Language) and the development of an International Standard Readers familiar with databases are probably aware of the Structured Query Language SQL. by using SQL, people access databases in a way that is close to natural language. Before SQL was widely adopted and standardized, the market for relational databases was very fragmented. Each vendor's product had a completely different way of accessing. Developers of the database product itself, developers of the tools surrounding the database product, and end-users of the database, all had to learn each product. When the SQL-89 standard was developed in 1989, the entire relational database market quickly focus on SQL-89. This greatly reduced the learning costs for the people mentioned above. GQL (Graph Query Language) assumes a role similar to SQL in the field of graph databases. Uses interacts with graphs with GQL. Unlike international standards such as SQL-89, there are no international standards for GQL. Two mainstream graph languages are Neo4j\u2019s Cypher and Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin. The former is often referred to as the DQL, Declarative Query Language. DQL tells the system \"what to do\", regardless of \"how to do\". The latter is referred to as the IQL, Imperative Query Language. IQL explicitly specifies the system's actions. The GQL International Standard is in the process of being developed.","title":"Neo4j, the pioneer of (first generation) graph databases"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#overview_of_the_recent_history_of_graph_databases","text":"In 2000, the idea of modeling data as a network came to the founders of Neo4j. In 2001, Neo4j developed the earliest core part of the code. In 2007, Neo4j started operating as a company. In 2009, Neo4j borrowed XPath as a graph query language. Gremlin 11 is also similar to XPath. In 2010, Marko Rodriguez, a Neo4j employee, used the term Property Graph to describe the data model of Neo4j and TinkerPop (Gremlin). In 2011, the first public version Neo4j 1.4 was released, and the first version of Cypher was released. In 2012, Neo4j 1.8 enabled you to write a Cypher. Neo4j 2.0 added labels and indexes. Cypher became a declarative graph query language. In 2015, Cypher was opened up by Neo4j through the openCypher project. In 2017, the ISO WG3 organization discussed how to use SQL to query property graph data. In 2018, Starting from the Neo4j 3.5 GA, the core of Neo4j only for the Enterprise Edition will no longer be open source. In 2019, ISO officially established two projects ISO/IEC JTC 1 N 14279 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32 N 3228 to develop an international standard for graph database language. In 2021, the $325 million Series F funding round for Neo4j marks the largest investment round in database history.","title":"Overview of the recent history of graph databases"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#the_early_history_of_neo4j","text":"The data model property graph was first conceived in 2000. The founders of Neo4j were developing a media management system, and the schema of the system was often changed. To adapt to such changes, Peter Neubauer, one of the founders, wanted to enable the system to be modeled to a conceptually interconnected network. A group of graduate students at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay implemented the earliest prototypes. Emil Eifr\u00e9m, the Neo4j co-founder, and these students spent a week extending Peter's idea into a more abstract model: vertices were connected by relationships, and key-values were used as properties of vertices and relationships. They developed a Java API to interact with this data model and implemented an abstraction layer on top of the relational database. Although this network model greatly improved productivity, its performance has been poor. So Johan Svensson, Neo4j co-founder, put a lot of effort into implementing a native data management system, that is Neo4j. For the first few years, Neo4j was successful as an in-house product. In 2007, the intellectual property of Neo4j was transferred to an independent database company. In the first public release of Neo4j ( Neo4j 1.4, 2011), the data model was consisted of vertices and typed edges. Vertices and edges have properties. The early versions of Neo4j did not have indexes. Applications had to construct their search structure from the root vertex. Because this was very unwieldy for the applications, Neo4j 2.0 (2013.12) introduced a new concept label on vertices. Based on labels, Neo4j can index some predefined vertex properties. \"Vertex\", \"Relationship\", \"Property\", \"Relationships can only have one label.\", \"Vertices can have zero or multiple labels.\". All these concepts form the data model definitions for Neo4j property graphs. With the later addition of indexing, Cypher became the main way of interacting with Neo4j. This is because the application developer only needs to focus on the data itself, not on the search structure that the developer built himself as mentioned above.","title":"The early history of Neo4j"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#the_creation_of_gremlin","text":"Gremlin is a graph query language based on Apache TinkerPop, which is close in style to a sequence of function (procedure) calls. Initially, Neo4j was queried through the Java API. applications could embed the query engine as a library into the application and then use the API to query the graph. The early Neo4j employees Tobias Lindaaker, Ivarsson, Peter Neubauer, and Marko Rodriguez used XPath as a graph query. Groovy provides loop structures, branching, and computation. This was the original prototype of Gremlin, the first version of which was released in November 2009. Later, Marko found a lot of problems with using two different parsers (XPath and Groovy) at the same time and changed Gremlin to a Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on Groovy.","title":"The creation of Gremlin"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#the_creation_of_cypher","text":"Gremlin, like Neo4j's Java API, was originally intended to be a procedural way of expressing how to query databases. It uses shorter syntaxes to query and remotely access databases through the network. The procedural nature of Gremlin requires users to know the best way to query results, which is still burdensome for application developers. Over the last 30 years, the declarative language SQL has been a great success. SQL can separate the declarative way to get data from how the engine gets data. So the Neo4j engineers wanted to develop a declarative graph query language. In 2010, Andr\u00e9s Taylor joined Neo4j as an engineer. Inspired by SQL, he started a project to develop graph query language, which was released as Neo4j 1.4 in 2011. The language is the ancestor of most graph query languages today - Cypher. Cypher's syntax is based on the use of ASCII art to describe graph patterns. This approach originally came from the annotations on how to describe graph patterns in the source code. An example can be seen as follows. Simply put, ASCII art uses printable text to describe vertices and edges. Cypher syntax uses () for vertices and -[]-> for edges. (query)-[modeled as]->(drawing) is used to represent a simple graph relationship (which can also be called graph schema): the starting vertex - query , the destination vertex - drawing , and the edge - modeled as . The first version of Cypher implemented graph reading, but users should specify vertices from which to start querying. Only from these vertices could graph schema matching be supported. In a later version, Neo4j 1.8, released in October 2012, Cypher added the ability to modify graphs. However, queries still need to specify which nodes to start from. In December 2013, Neo4j 2.0 introduced the concept of a label, which is essentially an index. This allows the query engine to use the index to select the vertices matched by the schema, without requiring the user to specify the vertex to start the query. With the popularity of Neo4j, Cypher has a wide community of developers and is widely used in a variety of industries. It is still the most popular graph query language. In September 2015, Neo4j established the openCypher Implementors Group (oCIG) to open source Cypher to openCypher, to govern and advance the evolution of the language itself through open source.","title":"The creation of Cypher"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#subsequent_events","text":"Cypher has inspired a series of graph query languages, including: 2015, Oracle released PGQL, a graph language used by the graph engine PGX. 2016, the Linked Data Benchmarking Council (short for LDBC) an industry-renowned benchmarking organization for graph performance, released G-CORE. 2018, RedisGraph, a Redis-based graph library, adopted Cypher as its graph language. 2019, the International Standards Organization ISO started two projects to initiate the process of developing an international standard for graph languages based on existing industry achievements such as openCypher, PGQL, GSQL 12 , and G-CORE. 2019, NebulaGraph released NebulaGraph Query Language (nGQL) based on openCypher.","title":"Subsequent events"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-1-graph-database/#distributed_graph_databases","text":"From 2005 to 2010, with the release of Google's cloud computing \"Troika\", various distributed architectures became increasingly popular, including Hadoop and Cassandra, which have been open-sourced.

Distributed systems allow applications to access these thousands of machines as if they were local systems, without the need for much modification at the code level. The open-source approach allows more people to know emerging technologies and feedback to the community in a more cost-effective way, including code developers, data scientists, and product managers.

Neo4j 3. x requires that the full amount of data must be stored on a single machine. Although it supports full replication and high availability between multiple machines, the data cannot be sliced into different subgraphs. Neo4j 4. x stores a part of data on different machines (subgraphs), and then the application layer assembles data in a certain way (called Fabric) 13 and distributes the reads and writes to each machine. This approach requires a log of involvement and work from the application layer code. For example, designing how to place different subgraphs on which machines they should be placed and how to assemble some of the results obtained from each machine into the final result.

It is easy for programmers to use, develop and participate in the community. Large-scale graphs could be sharded and stored on HBase or Cassandra (which were relatively mature distributed storage solutions at the time), and the Gremlin language was relatively full-featured though slightly lengthy.

Databases \u00b6 Relational databases \u00b6 A relational database is a database that uses a relational model to organize data. The relational model is a two-dimensional table model, and a relational database consists of two-dimensional tables and the relationships between them. When it comes to relational databases, most people think of MySQL, one of the most popular database management systems that support database operations using the most common structured query language (SQL) and stores data in the form of tables, rows, and columns. This approach to storing data is derived from the relational data model proposed by Edgar Frank Codd in 1970. In a relational database, a table can be created for each type of data to be stored. For example, the player table is used to store all player information, the team table is used to store team information. Each row of data in a SQL table must contain a primary key. The primary key is a unique identifier for the row of data. Generally, the primary key is self-incrementing with the number of rows as the field ID. Relational databases have served the computer industry very well since their inception and will continue to do so for a long time to come. If you have used Excel, WPS, or other similar applications, you have a rough idea of how relational databases work. First, you set up the columns, then you add rows of data under the corresponding columns. You can average or otherwise aggregate the data in a column, similar to averaging in a relational database MySQL. Pivot tables in Excel are the equivalent of querying data in a relational database MySQL using aggregation functions and CASE statements. An Excel file can have multiple tables, and a single table is equivalent to a single table in MySQL. An Excel file is similar to a MySQL database. Relationships in relational databases \u00b6 Unlike graph databases, edges in relational databases (or SQL-type databases) are also stored as entities in specialized edge tables. Two tables are created, player and team, and then player_team is created as an edge table. Edge tables are usually formed by joining related tables. For example, here the edge table player_team is made by joining the player table and the team table. The way of storing edges is not a big problem when associating small data sets, but problems arise when there are too many relationships in a relational database. Specifically, when you want to query just one player's teammates, you have to join all the data in the table and then filter out all the data you don't need, which puts a huge strain on the relational database when your dataset reaches a certain size. If you want to associate multiple different tables, the system may not be able to respond before the join bombs. Origins of relational databases \u00b6 As mentioned above, the relational data model was first proposed by Edgar Frank Codd, an IBM engineer, in 1970. Codd wrote several papers on database management systems that addressed the potential of the relational data model. The relational data model does not rely on linked lists of data (mesh or hierarchical data), but more on data sets. Using the mathematical method of tuple calculus, he argued that these datasets can perform the same tasks as a navigational database. The only requirement was that the relational data model needed a suitable query language to guarantee the consistency requirements of the database. This became the inspiration for declarative query languages such as Structured Query Language (SQL). IBM's System R was one of the first implementations of such a system. But Software Development Laboratories, a small company founded by ex-IBM people and one illustrious Mr.Larry Ellison, beat IBM to the market with the product that would become known as Oracle. Since the relational database was a trendy term at the time, many database vendors preferred to use it in their product names, even though their products were not actually relational. To prevent this and reduce the misuse of the relational data model, Codd introduced the famous Codd's 12 Rules. All relational data systems must follow Codd's 12 Rules. NoSQL databases \u00b6 Graph databases are not the only alternative that can overcome the shortcomings of relational databases. There are many non-relational database products on the market that can be called NoSQL. The term NoSQL was first introduced in the late 1990s and can be interpreted as \"not SQL\" or \"not only SQL\". For the sake of understanding, NoSQL can be interpreted as a \"non-relational database\" here. Unlike relational databases, the data storage and retrieval mechanisms provided by NoSQL databases are not modeled based on table relationships. NoSQL databases can be divided into four categories. Key-value Data Store Columnar Store Document Store Graph Store The following describes the four types of NoSQL databases. Key-value Data Store \u00b6 Key-value databases store data in unique key-value pairs. Unlike relational databases, key-value stores do not have tables and columns. A key-value database itself is like a large table with many columns (i.e., keys). In a key-value store database, data are stored and queried by means of keys, usually implemented as hash lists. This is much simpler than traditional SQL databases, and for some web applications, it is sufficient. The advantage of the key-value model for IT systems is that it is simple and easy to deploy. In most cases, this type of storage works well for unrelated data. If you are just storing data without querying it, there is no problem using this storage method. However, if the DBA only queries or updates some of the values, the key-value model becomes inefficient. Common key-value storage databases include Redis, Voldemort, and Oracle BDB. Columnar Store \u00b6 A NoSQL database's columnar store has many similarities to a NoSQL database's key-value store because the columnar store is still using keys for storage and retrieval. The difference is that in a columnar store database, the column is the smallest storage unit, and each column consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp for version control and conflict resolution. This is particularly useful when scaling in a distributed manner, as timestamps can be used to locate expired data when the database is updated. Because of the good scalability of columnar storage, the columnar store is suitable for very large data sets. Common columnar storage databases include HBase, Cassandra, HadoopDB, etc. Document Store \u00b6 A NoSQL database document store is a key-value-based database, but with enhanced functionality. Data is still stored as keys, but the values in a document store are structured documents, not just a string or a single value. That is, because of the increased information structure, document stores are able to perform more optimized queries and make data retrieval easier. Therefore, document stores are particularly well suited for storing, indexing, and managing document-oriented data or similar semi-structured data. Technically speaking, as a semi-structured unit of information, a document in a document store can be any form of document available, including XML, JSON, YAML, etc., depending on the design of the database vendor. For example, JSON is a common choice. While JSON is not the best choice for structured data, JSON-type data can be used in both front-end and back-end applications. Common document storage databases include MongoDB, CouchDB, Terrastore, etc. Graph Store \u00b6 The last class of NoSQL databases is graph databases. NebulaGraph, is also a graph database. Although graph databases are also NoSQL databases, graph databases are fundamentally different from the above-mentioned NoSQL databases. Graph databases store data in the form of vertices, edges, and properties. Its advantages include high flexibility, support for complex graph algorithms, and can be used to build complex relational graphs. We will discuss graph databases in detail in the subsequent topics. But in this topic, you just need to know that a graph database is a NoSQL type of database. Common graph databases include NebulaGraph, Neo4j, OrientDB, etc. Graph-related technologies \u00b6 Take a look at a panoramic view of graph technology in 2020 1 . There are many technologies that are related to graphs, which can be broadly classified into these categories: Infrastructure: Graph databases, graph computing (processing) engines, graph deep learning, cloud services, etc. Applications: Visualization, knowledge graph, anti-fraud, cyber security, social network, etc. Development tools: Graph query languages, modeling tools, development frameworks, and libraries. E-books 2 and conferences, etc. Graph language \u00b6 In the previous topic, we introduced the history of graph languages. In this section, we make a classification of the functions of graph languages. Nearest neighbor query (NNS): Query the neighboring edges, neighbors, or K-hops neighbors. Find one/all subgraphs that satisfy a given graph pattern. This problem is very close to Subgraph Isomorphism - two seemingly different graphs that are actually identical 3 as shown below. Reachability (connectivity) problems: The most common reachability problem is the shortest path problem. Such problems are usually described in terms of Regular Path Query - a series of connected groups of vertices forming a path that needs to satisfy some regular expression. Analytic problems: It is related to some convergent operators, such as Average, Count, Max, Vertex Degree. Measures the distance between all two vertices, the degree of interaction between a vertex and other vertices. Graph database and graph processing systems \u00b6 A graph system usually includes a complex data pipeline 4 . From the data source (the left side of the picture below) to the processing output (the right side), multiple data processing steps and systems are used, such as the ETL module, Graph OLTP module, OLAP module, BI, and knowledge graph. Graph databases and graph processing systems have different origins and specialties (and weaknesses). (Online) The graph database is designed for persistent storage management of graphs and efficient subgraph operations. Hard disks and network are the target operating devices, physical/logical data mapping, data integrity, and (fault) consistency are the main goals. Each request typically involves only a small part of the full graph and can usually be done on a single server. Request latency is usually in milliseconds or seconds, and request concurrency is typically in the thousands or hundreds of thousands. The early Neo4j was one of the origins of the graph database space. (Offline) The graph processing system is for high-volume, concurrency, iteration, processing, and analysis of the full graph. Memory and network are the target operating devices. Each request involves all graph vertices and requires all servers to be involved in its completion. The latency of a single request is in the range of minutes to hours (days). The request concurrency is in single digits. Google's Pregel 5 represents the typical origin of graph processing systems. Its point-centric programming abstraction and BSP's operational model constitute a programming paradigm that is a more graph-friendly API abstraction than the previous Hadoop Map-Reduce. 6 Graph sharding methods \u00b6 For large-scale graph data, it is difficult to store it in the memory of a single server, and even just storing the graph structure itself is not enough. By increasing the capacity of a single server, its cost price usually rises exponentially. As the volume of data increases, for example, 100 billion data already exceeds the capacity of all commercially available servers on the market. Another option is to shard data and place each shard on a different server to increase reliability and performance. For NoSQL systems, such as key-value or document systems, the sharding method is intuitive and natural. Each record and data unit can usually be placed on a different server based on the key or docID. However, the sharding of data structures like graphs is usually less intuitive, because usually, graphs are \"fully connected\" and each vertex can be connected to any other vertex in usually 6 hops. And it has been theoretically proven that the graph sharding problem is NP. When distributing the entire graph data across multiple servers, the cross-server network access latency is 10 times higher than the hardware (memory) access time inside the same server. Therefore, for some depth-first traversal scenarios, a large number of cross-network accesses occur, resulting in extremely high overall latency. 7 Usually, graphs have a clear power-law distribution. A small number of vertices have much denser neighboring edges than the average vertices. Though processing these vertices can usually be within the same server which reduces cross-network access, load will be far more heavier than the average. The common graph sharding methods are as follows: Application-level sharding: The application layer senses and controls which shard each vertex and edge should locate on based on the type of vertices and edges. A set of vertices of the same type is placed on one sharding and another set of vertices of the same type is placed on another sharding. Of course, for high reliability, the sharding itself can also be made multiple replicas. When used by the application, the desired vertices and edges are fetched from each shard, and then on the off-application side (or some proxy server-side), the fetched data is assembled into the final result. This is typically represented by the Neo4j 4. x Fabric. Using a distributed cache layer: Add a memory cache layer on the top of the hard disk and cache important portions of the sharding and data and preheat that cache. Adding read-only replicas or views: Add read-only replicas or create a view for some of the graph sharding, and pass the heavier load of read requests through these sharding servers. Performing fine-grained graph sharding: Form multiple small partitions of vertices and edges instead of one large sharding, and then place the more correlated partitions on the same server as much as possible. 8 . A mixture of these approaches is also used in specific engineering practices. Usually, offline graph processing systems perform some degree of graph preprocessing to improve the locality through an ETL process, while online graph database systems usually choose a periodic data rebalancing process to improve data locality. Technical challenges \u00b6 In the literature 9 , a thorough investigation of graphs and challenges is done, and the following lists the top ten graph technology challenges. Scalability: Loading and upgrading big graphs, performing graph computation and graph traversal, use of triggers and supernodes Visualization: Customizable layouts, rendering and display big images, and display dynamic and updated display Query language and programming API: Language expressiveness, standards compatibility, compatibility with existing systems, design of subqueries, and associative queries across multiple graphs Faster graph algorithms Easy to use (configuration and usage) Performance metrics and testing General graph technology software (e.g., to handle offline, online, streaming computations.) ETL Debug and test Open-source graph tools on single machines \u00b6 There is a common misconception about graph databases that any data access involving graph structure needs to be stored in a graph database. When the amount of data is not large, single machine memory is enough to store the data. You can use some single-machine open-source tools to store tens of millions of vertices and edges.

Industry databases and benchmarks \u00b6 LDBC \u00b6 LDBC 16 (Linked Data Benchmark Council) is a non-profit organization composed of hardware and software giants such as Oracle, Intel and mainstream graph database vendors such as Neo4j and TigerGraph, which is the benchmark guide developer and test result publisher for graphs and has a high influence in the industry. SNB (Social Network Benchmark) is one of the benchmarks developed by the Linked Data Benchmark Committee (LDBC) for graph databases and is divided into two scenarios: interactive query (Interactive) and business intelligence (BI). Its role is similar to that of TPC-C, TPC-H, and other tests in SQL-type databases, which can help users compare the functions, performance, and capacity of various graph database products. An SNB dataset simulates the relationship between people and posts of a social network, taking into account the distribution properties of the social network, the activity of people, and other social information. The standard data size ranges from 0.1 GB (scale factor 0.1) to 1000 GB (sf 1000). Larger data sets of 10 TB and 100 TB can also be generated. The number of vertices and edges is as shown below. Trends \u00b6 Graph technologies of different origins and goals are learning from and integrating with each other \u00b6 The trends in cloud computing place higher demands on scalability. \u00b6 According to Gartner's projections, cloud services have been growing at a rapid rate and penetration 17 . A large number of commercial software is gradually moving from a completely local and private model 10 years ago to a cloud services-based business model. One of the major advantages of cloud services is that they offer near-infinite scalability. It requires that various cloud infrastructure-based software must have a better ability to scale quickly and elastically. Trends in hardware that SSD will be the mainstream persistent device \u00b6 Hardware determines software architecture. From the 1950s, when Moore's Law was discovered, to the 00s, when multi-core was introduced, hardware trends and speeds have profoundly determined software architecture. Database systems are mostly designed around \"hard disk + memory\", high-performance computing systems are mostly designed around \"memory + CPU\", and distributed systems are designed completely differently for 1 gigabit, 10 gigabits, and RDMA. Graph traversals are featured as random access. Early graph database systems adopted the large memory + HDD architecture. By designing some data structure in memory, random access can be achieved in memory (B+ trees, Hash tables) for the purpose of optimizing graph topology traversal. And then the random access was converted into sequential reads and writes suitable for HDDs. The entire software architecture (including the storage and compute layers) must be based on and built around such IO processes. With the decline in SSD prices 18 , SSDs are replacing HDDs as the dominant device. Friendly random access, deep IO queue, fast access are the features of SSD that differ from HDD's highly repetitive sequence, random latency, and easily damaged disk. The redesign for all software architectures becomes a heavy historical technical burden. https://graphaware.com/graphaware/2020/02/17/graph-technology-landscape-2020.html \u21a9 Electronic copies are available for learning purposes by contacting Author . \u21a9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism \u21a9 The Future is Big Graphs!

The relational model is a two-dimensional table model, and a relational database consists of two-dimensional tables and the relationships between them. When it comes to relational databases, most people think of MySQL, one of the most popular database management systems that support database operations using the most common structured query language (SQL) and stores data in the form of tables, rows, and columns. This approach to storing data is derived from the relational data model proposed by Edgar Frank Codd in 1970. In a relational database, a table can be created for each type of data to be stored. For example, the player table is used to store all player information, the team table is used to store team information. Each row of data in a SQL table must contain a primary key. The primary key is a unique identifier for the row of data. Generally, the primary key is self-incrementing with the number of rows as the field ID. Relational databases have served the computer industry very well since their inception and will continue to do so for a long time to come. If you have used Excel, WPS, or other similar applications, you have a rough idea of how relational databases work. First, you set up the columns, then you add rows of data under the corresponding columns. You can average or otherwise aggregate the data in a column, similar to averaging in a relational database MySQL. Pivot tables in Excel are the equivalent of querying data in a relational database MySQL using aggregation functions and CASE statements. An Excel file can have multiple tables, and a single table is equivalent to a single table in MySQL. An Excel file is similar to a MySQL database.","title":"Relational databases"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-2.relates/#relationships_in_relational_databases","text":"Unlike graph databases, edges in relational databases (or SQL-type databases) are also stored as entities in specialized edge tables. Two tables are created, player and team, and then player_team is created as an edge table. Edge tables are usually formed by joining related tables. For example, here the edge table player_team is made by joining the player table and the team table. The way of storing edges is not a big problem when associating small data sets, but problems arise when there are too many relationships in a relational database. Specifically, when you want to query just one player's teammates, you have to join all the data in the table and then filter out all the data you don't need, which puts a huge strain on the relational database when your dataset reaches a certain size. If you want to associate multiple different tables, the system may not be able to respond before the join bombs.","title":"Relationships in relational databases"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-2.relates/#origins_of_relational_databases","text":"As mentioned above, the relational data model was first proposed by Edgar Frank Codd, an IBM engineer, in 1970. Codd wrote several papers on database management systems that addressed the potential of the relational data model. The relational data model does not rely on linked lists of data (mesh or hierarchical data), but more on data sets. Using the mathematical method of tuple calculus, he argued that these datasets can perform the same tasks as a navigational database. The only requirement was that the relational data model needed a suitable query language to guarantee the consistency requirements of the database. This became the inspiration for declarative query languages such as Structured Query Language (SQL). IBM's System R was one of the first implementations of such a system. But Software Development Laboratories, a small company founded by ex-IBM people and one illustrious Mr.Larry Ellison, beat IBM to the market with the product that would become known as Oracle. Since the relational database was a trendy term at the time, many database vendors preferred to use it in their product names, even though their products were not actually relational. To prevent this and reduce the misuse of the relational data model, Codd introduced the famous Codd's 12 Rules. All relational data systems must follow Codd's 12 Rules.","title":"Origins of relational databases"},{"location":"1.introduction/0-2.relates/#nosql_databases","text":"Graph databases are not the only alternative that can overcome the shortcomings of relational databases. There are many non-relational database products on the market that can be called NoSQL. The term NoSQL was first introduced in the late 1990s and can be interpreted as \"not SQL\" or \"not only SQL\". For the sake of understanding, NoSQL can be interpreted as a \"non-relational database\" here. Unlike relational databases, the data storage and retrieval mechanisms provided by NoSQL databases are not modeled based on table relationships. NoSQL databases can be divided into four categories.

Unlike relational databases, key-value stores do not have tables and columns. A key-value database itself is like a large table with many columns (i.e., keys). In a key-value store database, data are stored and queried by means of keys, usually implemented as hash lists. This is much simpler than traditional SQL databases, and for some web applications, it is sufficient. The advantage of the key-value model for IT systems is that it is simple and easy to deploy. In most cases, this type of storage works well for unrelated data. If you are just storing data without querying it, there is no problem using this storage method. However, if the DBA only queries or updates some of the values, the key-value model becomes inefficient.

The difference is that in a columnar store database, the column is the smallest storage unit, and each column consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp for version control and conflict resolution. This is particularly useful when scaling in a distributed manner, as timestamps can be used to locate expired data when the database is updated. Because of the good scalability of columnar storage, the columnar store is suitable for very large data sets.

Therefore, document stores are particularly well suited for storing, indexing, and managing document-oriented data or similar semi-structured data. Technically speaking, as a semi-structured unit of information, a document in a document store can be any form of document available, including XML, JSON, YAML, etc., depending on the design of the database vendor.

From the data source (the left side of the picture below) to the processing output (the right side), multiple data processing steps and systems are used, such as the ETL module, Graph OLTP module, OLAP module, BI, and knowledge graph. Graph databases and graph processing systems have different origins and specialties (and weaknesses). (Online) The graph database is designed for persistent storage management of graphs and efficient subgraph operations. Hard disks and network are the target operating devices, physical/logical data mapping, data integrity, and (fault) consistency are the main goals. Each request typically involves only a small part of the full graph and can usually be done on a single server. Request latency is usually in milliseconds or seconds, and request concurrency is typically in the thousands or hundreds of thousands. The early Neo4j was one of the origins of the graph database space. (Offline) The graph processing system is for high-volume, concurrency, iteration, processing, and analysis of the full graph. Memory and network are the target operating devices. Each request involves all graph vertices and requires all servers to be involved in its completion. The latency of a single request is in the range of minutes to hours (days). The request concurrency is in single digits. Google's Pregel 5 represents the typical origin of graph processing systems.

By increasing the capacity of a single server, its cost price usually rises exponentially. As the volume of data increases, for example, 100 billion data already exceeds the capacity of all commercially available servers on the market. Another option is to shard data and place each shard on a different server to increase reliability and performance. For NoSQL systems, such as key-value or document systems, the sharding method is intuitive and natural. Each record and data unit can usually be placed on a different server based on the key or docID. However, the sharding of data structures like graphs is usually less intuitive, because usually, graphs are \"fully connected\" and each vertex can be connected to any other vertex in usually 6 hops. And it has been theoretically proven that the graph sharding problem is NP. When distributing the entire graph data across multiple servers, the cross-server network access latency is 10 times higher than the hardware (memory) access time inside the same server. Therefore, for some depth-first traversal scenarios, a large number of cross-network accesses occur, resulting in extremely high overall latency. 7 Usually, graphs have a clear power-law distribution. A small number of vertices have much denser neighboring edges than the average vertices. Though processing these vertices can usually be within the same server which reduces cross-network access, load will be far more heavier than the average. The common graph sharding methods are as follows: Application-level sharding: The application layer senses and controls which shard each vertex and edge should locate on based on the type of vertices and edges.

It is capable of hosting graphs with hundreds of billions of vertices and trillions of edges, and serving queries with millisecond-latency. What is a graph database \u00b6 A graph database, such as NebulaGraph, is a database that specializes in storing vast graph networks and retrieving information from them. It efficiently stores data as vertices (nodes) and edges (relationships) in labeled property graphs. Properties can be attached to both vertices and edges. Each vertex can have one or multiple tags (labels). Graph databases are well suited for storing most kinds of data models abstracted from reality. Things are connected in almost all fields in the world. Modeling systems like relational databases extract the relationships between entities and squeeze them into table columns alone, with their types and properties stored in other columns or even other tables. This makes data management time-consuming and cost-ineffective. NebulaGraph, as a typical native graph database, allows you to store the rich relationships as edges with edge types and properties directly attached to them. Advantages of NebulaGraph \u00b6 Open source \u00b6 NebulaGraph is open under the Apache 2.0 License.

It efficiently stores data as vertices (nodes) and edges (relationships) in labeled property graphs. Properties can be attached to both vertices and edges. Each vertex can have one or multiple tags (labels). Graph databases are well suited for storing most kinds of data models abstracted from reality. Things are connected in almost all fields in the world. Modeling systems like relational databases extract the relationships between entities and squeeze them into table columns alone, with their types and properties stored in other columns or even other tables. This makes data management time-consuming and cost-ineffective. NebulaGraph, as a typical native graph database, allows you to store the rich relationships as edges with edge types and properties directly attached to them.","title":"What is a graph database"},{"location":"1.introduction/1.what-is-nebula-graph/#advantages_of_nebulagraph","text":"","title":"Advantages of NebulaGraph"},{"location":"1.introduction/1.what-is-nebula-graph/#open_source","text":"NebulaGraph is open under the Apache 2.0 License.

This topic describes the Nebula Graph data model and provides suggestions for data modeling with NebulaGraph. Data structures \u00b6 NebulaGraph data model uses six data structures to store data. They are graph spaces, vertices, edges, tags, edge types and properties. Graph spaces : Graph spaces are used to isolate data from different teams or programs. Data stored in different graph spaces are securely isolated. Storage replications, privileges, and partitions can be assigned. Vertices : Vertices are used to store entities. In NebulaGraph, vertices are identified with vertex identifiers (i.e. VID ). The VID must be unique in the same graph space. VID should be int64, or fixed_string(N). A vertex has zero to multiple tags. Compatibility In NebulaGraph 2.x a vertex must have at least one tag. And in NebulaGraph 3.5.0, a tag is not required for a vertex. Edges : Edges are used to connect vertices. An edge is a connection or behavior between two vertices. There can be multiple edges between two vertices. Edges are directed. -> identifies the directions of edges. Edges can be traversed in either direction. An edge is identified uniquely with <a source vertex, an edge type, a rank value, and a destination vertex> . Edges have no EID. An edge must have one and only one edge type. The rank value is an immutable user-assigned 64-bit signed integer. It identifies the edges with the same edge type between two vertices. Edges are sorted by their rank values. The edge with the greatest rank value is listed first. The default rank value is zero. Tags : Tags are used to categorize vertices. Vertices that have the same tag share the same definition of properties. Edge types : Edge types are used to categorize edges. Edges that have the same edge type share the same definition of properties. Properties : Properties are key-value pairs. Both vertices and edges are containers for properties. Note Tags and Edge types are similar to \"vertex tables\" and \"edge tables\" in the relational databases. Directed property graph \u00b6 NebulaGraph stores data in directed property graphs. A directed property graph has a set of vertices connected by directed edges. Both vertices and edges can have properties. A directed property graph is represented as: G = < V, E, P V , P E > V is a set of vertices. E is a set of directed edges. P V is the property of vertices. P E is the property of edges. The following table is an example of the structure of the basketball player dataset. We have two types of vertices, that is player and team , and two types of edges, that is serve and follow . Element Name Property name (Data type) Description Tag player name (string) age (int) Represents players in the team. Tag team name (string) Represents the teams. Edge type serve start_year (int) end_year (int) Represents actions taken by players in the team. An action links a player with a team, and the direction is from a player to a team.

Features \u00b6 The data types of VIDs are restricted to FIXED_STRING(<N>) or INT64 . One graph space can only select one VID type. A VID in a graph space is unique. It functions just as a primary key in a relational database. VIDs in different graph spaces are independent. The VID generation method must be set by users, because NebulaGraph does not provide auto increasing ID, or UUID. Vertices with the same VID will be identified as the same one. For example: A VID is the unique identifier of an entity, like a person's ID card number. A tag means the type of an entity, such as driver, and boss. Different tags define two groups of different properties, such as driving license number, driving age, order amount, order taking alt, and job number, payroll, debt ceiling, business phone number. When two INSERT statements (neither uses a parameter of IF NOT EXISTS ) with the same VID and tag are operated at the same time, the latter INSERT will overwrite the former. When two INSERT statements with the same VID but different tags, like TAG A and TAG B , are operated at the same time, the operation of Tag A will not affect Tag B . VIDs will usually be indexed and stored into memory (in the way of LSM-tree). Thus, direct access to VIDs enjoys peak performance. VID Operation \u00b6 NebulaGraph 1.x only supports INT64 while NebulaGraph 2.x supports INT64 and FIXED_STRING(<N>) . In CREATE SPACE , VID types can be set via vid_type . id() function can be used to specify or locate a VID. LOOKUP or MATCH statements can be used to find a VID via property index. Direct access to vertices statements via VIDs enjoys peak performance, such as DELETE xxx WHERE id(xxx) == \"player100\" or GO FROM \"player100\" . Finding VIDs via properties and then operating the graph will cause poor performance, such as LOOKUP | GO FROM $-.ids , which will run both LOOKUP and | one more time. VID Generation \u00b6 VIDs can be generated via applications. Here are some tips: (Optimal) Directly take a unique primary key or property as a VID. Property access depends on the VID. Generate a VID via a unique combination of properties. Property access depends on property index. Generate a VID via algorithms like snowflake. Property access depends on property index. If short primary keys greatly outnumber long primary keys, do not enlarge the N of FIXED_STRING(<N>) too much. Otherwise, it will occupy a lot of memory and hard disks, and slow down performance. Generate VIDs via BASE64, MD5, hash by encoding and splicing. If you generate int64 VID via hash, the probability of collision is about 1/10 when there are 1 billion vertices. The number of edges has no concern with the probability of collision. Define and modify a VID and its data type \u00b6 The data type of a VID must be defined when you create the graph space . Once defined, it cannot be modified. A VID is set when you insert a vertex and cannot be modified. Query start vid and global scan \u00b6 In most cases, the execution plan of query statements in NebulaGraph ( MATCH , GO , and LOOKUP ) must query the start vid in a certain way. There are only two ways to locate start vid : For example, GO FROM \"player100\" OVER explicitly indicates in the statement that start vid is \"player100\". For example, LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == \"Tony Parker\" or MATCH (v:player {name:\"Tony Parker\"}) locates start vid by the index of the property player.name .","title":"VID"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.vid/#vid","text":"In a graph space, a vertex is uniquely identified by its ID, which is called a VID or a Vertex ID.","title":"VID"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.vid/#features","text":"The data types of VIDs are restricted to FIXED_STRING(<N>) or INT64 .

The architecture of the Meta Service \u00b6 The architecture of the Meta Service is as follows: The Meta Service is run by nebula-metad processes. Users can deploy nebula-metad processes according to the scenario: In a test environment, users can deploy one or three nebula-metad processes on different machines or a single machine. In a production environment, we recommend that users deploy three nebula-metad processes on different machines for high availability. All the nebula-metad processes form a Raft-based cluster, with one process as the leader and the others as the followers. The leader is elected by the majorities and only the leader can provide service to the clients or other components of NebulaGraph. The followers will be run in a standby way and each has a data replication of the leader. Once the leader fails, one of the followers will be elected as the new leader. Note The data of the leader and the followers will keep consistent through Raft. Thus the breakdown and election of the leader will not cause data inconsistency. For more information on Raft, see Storage service architecture . Functions of the Meta Service \u00b6 Manages user accounts \u00b6 The Meta Service stores the information of user accounts and the privileges granted to the accounts. When the clients send queries to the Meta Service through an account, the Meta Service checks the account information and whether the account has the right privileges to execute the queries or not. For more information on NebulaGraph access control, see Authentication . Manages partitions \u00b6 The Meta Service stores and manages the locations of the storage partitions and helps balance the partitions. Manages graph spaces \u00b6 NebulaGraph supports multiple graph spaces. Data stored in different graph spaces are securely isolated. The Meta Service stores the metadata of all graph spaces and tracks the changes of them, such as adding or dropping a graph space. Manages schema information \u00b6 NebulaGraph is a strong-typed graph database. Its schema contains tags (i.e., the vertex types), edge types, tag properties, and edge type properties. The Meta Service stores the schema information. Besides, it performs the addition, modification, and deletion of the schema, and logs the versions of them. For more information on NebulaGraph schema, see Data model .

It has four submodules: Parser, Validator, Planner, and Executor. This topic will describe the Graph Service accordingly. The architecture of the Graph Service \u00b6 After a query is sent to the Graph Service, it will be processed by the following four submodules: Parser : Performs lexical analysis and syntax analysis. Validator : Validates the statements. Planner : Generates and optimizes the execution plans. Executor : Executes the plans with operators. Parser \u00b6 After receiving a request, the statements will be parsed by Parser composed of Flex (lexical analysis tool) and Bison (syntax analysis tool), and its corresponding AST will be generated. Statements will be directly intercepted in this stage because of their invalid syntax. For example, the structure of the AST of GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like WHERE properties(edge).likeness > 8.0 YIELD dst(edge) is shown in the following figure. Validator \u00b6 Validator performs a series of validations on the AST. It mainly works on these tasks: Validating metadata Validator will validate whether the metadata is correct or not. When parsing the OVER , WHERE , and YIELD clauses, Validator looks up the Schema and verifies whether the edge type and tag data exist or not. For an INSERT statement, Validator verifies whether the types of the inserted data are the same as the ones defined in the Schema. Validating contextual reference Validator will verify whether the cited variable exists or not, or whether the cited property is variable or not. For composite statements, like $var = GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like YIELD dst(edge) AS ID; GO FROM $var.ID OVER serve YIELD dst(edge) , Validator verifies first to see if var is defined, and then to check if the ID property is attached to the var variable. Validating type inference Validator infers what type the result of an expression is and verifies the type against the specified clause. For example, the WHERE clause requires the result to be a bool value, a NULL value, or empty . Validating the information of * Validator needs to verify all the Schema that involves * when verifying the clause if there is a * in the statement. Take a statement like GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER * YIELD dst(edge), properties(edge).likeness, dst(edge) as an example. When verifying the OVER clause, Validator needs to verify all the edge types. If the edge type includes like and serve , the statement would be GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like,serve YIELD dst(edge), properties(edge).likeness, dst(edge) . Validating input and output Validator will check the consistency of the clauses before and after the | . In the statement GO FROM \"Tim\" OVER like YIELD dst(edge) AS ID | GO FROM $-.ID OVER serve YIELD dst(edge) , Validator will verify whether $-.ID is defined in the clause before the | . When the validation succeeds, an execution plan will be generated. Its data structure will be stored in the src/planner directory. Planner \u00b6 In the nebula-graphd.conf file, when enable_optimizer is set to be false , Planner will not optimize the execution plans generated by Validator. It will be executed by Executor directly. In the nebula-graphd.conf file, when enable_optimizer is set to be true , Planner will optimize the execution plans generated by Validator. The structure is as follows. Before optimization In the execution plan on the right side of the preceding figure, each node directly depends on other nodes. For example, the root node Project depends on the Filter node, the Filter node depends on the GetNeighbor node, and so on, up to the leaf node Start . Then the execution plan is (not truly) executed. During this stage, every node has its input and output variables, which are stored in a hash table. The execution plan is not truly executed, so the value of each key in the associated hash table is empty (except for the Start node, where the input variables hold the starting data), and the hash table is defined in src/context/ExecutionContext.cpp under the nebula-graph repository. For example, if the hash table is named as ResultMap when creating the Filter node, users can determine that the node takes data from ResultMap[\"GN1\"] , then puts the result into ResultMap[\"Filter2\"] , and so on. All these work as the input and output of each node. Process of optimization The optimization rules that Planner has implemented so far are considered RBO (Rule-Based Optimization), namely the pre-defined optimization rules. The CBO (Cost-Based Optimization) feature is under development. The optimized code is in the src/optimizer/ directory under the nebula-graph repository. RBO is a \u201cbottom-up\u201d exploration process. For each rule, the root node of the execution plan (in this case, the Project node) is the entry point, and step by step along with the node dependencies, it reaches the node at the bottom to see if it matches the rule. As shown in the preceding figure, when the Filter node is explored, it is found that its children node is GetNeighbors , which matches successfully with the pre-defined rules, so a transformation is initiated to integrate the Filter node into the GetNeighbors node, the Filter node is removed, and then the process continues to the next rule. Therefore, when the GetNeighbor operator calls interfaces of the Storage layer to get the neighboring edges of a vertex during the execution stage, the Storage layer will directly filter out the unqualified edges internally. Such optimization greatly reduces the amount of data transfer, which is commonly known as filter pushdown. Executor \u00b6 The Executor module consists of Scheduler and Executor. The Scheduler generates the corresponding execution operators against the execution plan, starting from the leaf nodes and ending at the root node. The structure is as follows. Each node of the execution plan has one execution operator node, whose input and output have been determined in the execution plan. Each operator only needs to get the values for the input variables, compute them, and finally put the results into the corresponding output variables. Therefore, it is only necessary to execute step by step from Start , and the result of the last operator is returned to the user as the final result.

One is the Meta Service that stores the meta-related data. The other is the Storage Service that stores the data, which is run by the nebula-storaged process. This topic will describe the architecture of the Storage Service. Advantages \u00b6 High performance (Customized built-in KVStore) Great scalability (Shared-nothing architecture, not rely on NAS/SAN-like devices) Strong consistency (Raft) High availability (Raft) Supports synchronizing with the third party systems, such as Elasticsearch . The architecture of the Storage Service \u00b6 The Storage Service is run by the nebula-storaged process. Users can deploy nebula-storaged processes on different occasions. For example, users can deploy 1 nebula-storaged process in a test environment and deploy 3 nebula-storaged processes in a production environment. All the nebula-storaged processes consist of a Raft-based cluster. There are three layers in the Storage Service: Storage interface The top layer is the storage interface. It defines a set of APIs that are related to the graph concepts. These API requests will be translated into a set of KV operations targeting the corresponding Partition . For example: getNeighbors : queries the in-edge or out-edge of a set of vertices, returns the edges and the corresponding properties, and supports conditional filtering. insert vertex/edge : inserts a vertex or edge and its properties. getProps : gets the properties of a vertex or an edge. It is this layer that makes the Storage Service a real graph storage. Otherwise, it is just a KV storage. Consensus Below the storage interface is the consensus layer that implements Multi Group Raft , which ensures the strong consistency and high availability of the Storage Service. Store engine The bottom layer is the local storage engine library, providing operations like get , put , and scan on local disks. The related interfaces are stored in KVStore.h and KVEngine.h files. You can develop your own local store plugins based on your needs. The following will describe some features of the Storage Service based on the above architecture. Storage writing process \u00b6 KVStore \u00b6 NebulaGraph develops and customizes its built-in KVStore for the following reasons. It is a high-performance KVStore. It is provided as a (kv) library and can be easily developed for the filter pushdown purpose. As a strong-typed database, how to provide Schema during pushdown is the key to efficiency for NebulaGraph. It has strong data consistency. Therefore, NebulaGraph develops its own KVStore with RocksDB as the local storage engine. The advantages are as follows. For multiple local hard disks, NebulaGraph can make full use of its concurrent capacities through deploying multiple data directories. The Meta Service manages all the Storage servers. All the partition distribution data and current machine status can be found in the meta service. Accordingly, users can execute a manual load balancing plan in meta service. Note NebulaGraph does not support auto load balancing because auto data transfer will affect online business. NebulaGraph provides its own WAL mode so one can customize the WAL. Each partition owns its WAL. One NebulaGraph KVStore cluster supports multiple graph spaces, and each graph space has its own partition number and replica copies. Different graph spaces are isolated physically from each other in the same cluster. Data storage structure \u00b6 Graphs consist of vertices and edges. NebulaGraph uses key-value pairs to store vertices, edges, and their properties. Vertices and edges are stored in keys and their properties are stored in values. Such structure enables efficient property filtering. The storage structure of vertices Different from NebulaGraph version 2.x, version 3.x added a new key for each vertex. Compared to the old key that still exists, the new key has no TagID field and no value. Vertices in NebulaGraph can now live without tags owing to the new key. Field Description Type One byte, used to indicate the key type. PartID Three bytes, used to indicate the sharding partition and to scan the partition data based on the prefix when re-balancing the partition. VertexID The vertex ID. For an integer VertexID, it occupies eight bytes. However, for a string VertexID, it is changed to fixed_string of a fixed length which needs to be specified by users when they create the space. TagID Four bytes, used to indicate the tags that vertex relate with. SerializedValue The serialized value of the key. It stores the property information of the vertex. The storage structure of edges Field Description Type One byte, used to indicate the key type. PartID Three bytes, used to indicate the partition ID. This field can be used to scan the partition data based on the prefix when re-balancing the partition. VertexID Used to indicate vertex ID. The former VID refers to the source VID in the outgoing edge and the dest VID in the incoming edge, while the latter VID refers to the dest VID in the outgoing edge and the source VID in the incoming edge. Edge Type Four bytes, used to indicate the edge type. Greater than zero indicates out-edge, less than zero means in-edge. Rank Eight bytes, used to indicate multiple edges in one edge type. Users can set the field based on needs and store weight, such as transaction time and transaction number. PlaceHolder One byte. Reserved. SerializedValue The serialized value of the key. It stores the property information of the edge. Property descriptions \u00b6 NebulaGraph uses strong-typed Schema. NebulaGraph will store the properties of vertex and edges in order after encoding them. Since the length of properties is fixed, queries can be made in no time according to offset. Before decoding, NebulaGraph needs to get (and cache) the schema information in the Meta Service. In addition, when encoding properties, NebulaGraph will add the corresponding schema version to support online schema change. Data partitioning \u00b6 Since in an ultra-large-scale relational network, vertices can be as many as tens to hundreds of billions, and edges are even more than trillions. Even if only vertices and edges are stored, the storage capacity of both exceeds that of ordinary servers. Therefore, NebulaGraph uses hash to shard the graph elements and store them in different partitions. Edge partitioning and storage amplification \u00b6 In NebulaGraph, an edge corresponds to two key-value pairs on the hard disk. When there are lots of edges and each has many properties, storage amplification will be obvious. The storage format of edges is shown in the figure below. In this example, SrcVertex connects DstVertex via EdgeA, forming the path of (SrcVertex)-[EdgeA]->(DstVertex) . SrcVertex, DstVertex, and EdgeA will all be stored in Partition x and Partition y as four key-value pairs in the storage layer. Details are as follows: The key value of SrcVertex is stored in Partition x. Key fields include Type, PartID(x), VID(Src), and TagID. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized vertex properties. The first key value of EdgeA, namely EdgeA_Out, is stored in the same partition as the SrcVertex. Key fields include Type, PartID(x), VID(Src), EdgeType(+ means out-edge), Rank(0), VID(Dst), and PlaceHolder. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized edge properties. The key value of DstVertex is stored in Partition y. Key fields include Type, PartID(y), VID(Dst), and TagID. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized vertex properties. The second key value of EdgeA, namely EdgeA_In, is stored in the same partition as the DstVertex. Key fields include Type, PartID(y), VID(Dst), EdgeType(- means in-edge), Rank(0), VID(Src), and PlaceHolder. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized edge properties, which is exactly the same as that in EdgeA_Out. EdgeA_Out and EdgeA_In are stored in storage layer with opposite directions, constituting EdgeA logically. EdgeA_Out is used for traversal requests starting from SrcVertex, such as (a)-[]->() ; EdgeA_In is used for traversal requests starting from DstVertex, such as ()-[]->(a) . Like EdgeA_Out and EdgeA_In, NebulaGraph redundantly stores the information of each edge, which doubles the actual capacities needed for edge storage. The key corresponding to the edge occupies a small hard disk space, but the space occupied by Value is proportional to the length and amount of the property value. Therefore, it will occupy a relatively large hard disk space if the property value of the edge is large or there are many edge property values. Partition algorithm \u00b6 NebulaGraph uses a static Hash strategy to shard data through a modulo operation on vertex ID. All the out-keys, in-keys, and tag data will be placed in the same partition. In this way, query efficiency is increased dramatically. Note The number of partitions needs to be determined when users are creating a graph space since it cannot be changed afterward. Users are supposed to take into consideration the demands of future business when setting it. When inserting into NebulaGraph, vertices and edges are distributed across different partitions. And the partitions are located on different machines. The number of partitions is set in the CREATE SPACE statement and cannot be changed afterward. If certain vertices need to be placed on the same partition (i.e., on the same machine), see Formula/code . The following code will briefly describe the relationship between VID and partition. // If VertexID occupies 8 bytes, it will be stored in int64 to be compatible with the version 1.0. uint64_t vid = 0; if (id.size() == 8) { memcpy(static_cast<void*>(&vid), id.data(), 8); } else { MurmurHash2 hash; vid = hash(id.data()); } PartitionID pId = vid % numParts + 1; Roughly speaking, after hashing a fixed string to int64, (the hashing of int64 is the number itself), do modulo, and then plus one, namely: pId = vid % numParts + 1 ; Parameters and descriptions of the preceding formula are as follows: Parameter Description % The modulo operation. numParts The number of partitions for the graph space where the VID is located, namely the value of partition_num in the CREATE SPACE statement. pId The ID for the partition where the VID is located. Suppose there are 100 partitions, the vertices with VID 1, 101, and 1001 will be stored on the same partition. But, the mapping between the partition ID and the machine address is random. Therefore, we cannot assume that any two partitions are located on the same machine. Raft \u00b6 Raft implementation \u00b6 In a distributed system, one data usually has multiple replicas so that the system can still run normally even if a few copies fail. It requires certain technical means to ensure consistency between replicas. Basic principle: Raft is designed to ensure consistency between replicas. Raft uses election between replicas, and the (candidate) replica that wins more than half of the votes will become the Leader, providing external services on behalf of all replicas. The rest Followers will play backups. When the Leader fails (due to communication failure, operation and maintenance commands, etc.), the rest Followers will conduct a new round of elections and vote for a new Leader. The Leader and Followers will detect each other's survival through heartbeats and write them to the hard disk in Raft-wal mode. Replicas that do not respond to more than multiple heartbeats will be considered faulty. Note Raft-wal needs to be written into the hard disk periodically. If hard disk bottlenecks to write, Raft will fail to send a heartbeat and conduct a new round of elections. If the hard disk IO is severely blocked, there will be no Leader for a long time. Read and write: For every writing request of the clients, the Leader will initiate a Raft-wal and synchronize it with the Followers. Only after over half replicas have received the Raft-wal will it return to the clients successfully. For every reading request of the clients, it will get to the Leader directly, while Followers will not be involved. Failure: Scenario 1: Take a (space) cluster of a single replica as an example. If the system has only one replica, the Leader will be itself. If failure happens, the system will be completely unavailable. Scenario 2: Take a (space) cluster of three replicas as an example. If the system has three replicas, one of them will be the Leader and the rest will be the Followers. If the Leader fails, the rest two can still vote for a new Leader (and a Follower), and the system is still available. But if any of the two Followers fails again, the system will be completely unavailable due to inadequate voters. Note Raft and HDFS have different modes of duplication. Raft is based on a quorum vote, so the number of replicas cannot be even. Multi Group Raft \u00b6 The Storage Service supports a distributed cluster architecture, so NebulaGraph implements Multi Group Raft according to Raft protocol. Each Raft group stores all the replicas of each partition. One replica is the leader, while others are followers. In this way, NebulaGraph achieves strong consistency and high availability. The functions of Raft are as follows. NebulaGraph uses Multi Group Raft to improve performance when there are many partitions because Raft-wal cannot be NULL. When there are too many partitions, costs will increase, such as storing information in Raft group, WAL files, or batch operation in low load. There are two key points to implement the Multi Raft Group: To share transport layer Each Raft Group sends messages to its corresponding peers. So if the transport layer cannot be shared, the connection costs will be very high. To share thread pool Raft Groups share the same thread pool to prevent starting too many threads and a high context switch cost. Batch \u00b6 For each partition, it is necessary to do a batch to improve throughput when writing the WAL serially. As NebulaGraph uses WAL to implement some special functions, batches need to be grouped, which is a feature of NebulaGraph. For example, lock-free CAS operations will execute after all the previous WALs are committed. So for a batch, if there are several WALs in CAS type, we need to divide this batch into several smaller groups and make sure they are committed serially. Transfer Leadership \u00b6 Transfer leadership is extremely important for balance. When moving a partition from one machine to another, NebulaGraph first checks if the source is a leader. If so, it should be moved to another peer. After data migration is completed, it is important to balance leader distribution again. When a transfer leadership command is committed, the leader will abandon its leadership and the followers will start a leader election. Peer changes \u00b6 To avoid split-brain, when members in a Raft Group change, an intermediate state is required. In such a state, the quorum of the old group and new group always have an overlap. Thus it prevents the old or new group from making decisions unilaterally. To make it even simpler, in his doctoral thesis Diego Ongaro suggests adding or removing a peer once to ensure the overlap between the quorum of the new group and the old group. NebulaGraph also uses this approach, except that the way to add or remove a member is different. For details, please refer to addPeer/removePeer in the Raft Part class. Differences with HDFS \u00b6 The Storage Service is a Raft-based distributed architecture, which has certain differences with that of HDFS. For example: The Storage Service ensures consistency through Raft. Usually, the number of its replicas is odd to elect a leader. However, DataNode used by HDFS ensures consistency through NameNode, which has no limit on the number of replicas. In the Storage Service, only the replicas of the leader can read and write, while in HDFS all the replicas can do so. In the Storage Service, the number of replicas needs to be determined when creating a space, since it cannot be changed afterward. But in HDFS, the number of replicas can be changed freely. The Storage Service can access the file system directly. While the applications of HDFS (such as HBase) have to access HDFS before the file system, which requires more RPC times. In a word, the Storage Service is more lightweight with some functions simplified and its architecture is simpler than HDFS, which can effectively improve the read and write performance of a smaller block of data.","title":"Storage Service"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#storage_service","text":"The persistent data of NebulaGraph have two parts.

For example, users can deploy 1 nebula-storaged process in a test environment and deploy 3 nebula-storaged processes in a production environment. All the nebula-storaged processes consist of a Raft-based cluster. There are three layers in the Storage Service: Storage interface The top layer is the storage interface. It defines a set of APIs that are related to the graph concepts. These API requests will be translated into a set of KV operations targeting the corresponding Partition . For example: getNeighbors : queries the in-edge or out-edge of a set of vertices, returns the edges and the corresponding properties, and supports conditional filtering. insert vertex/edge : inserts a vertex or edge and its properties. getProps : gets the properties of a vertex or an edge. It is this layer that makes the Storage Service a real graph storage. Otherwise, it is just a KV storage. Consensus Below the storage interface is the consensus layer that implements Multi Group Raft , which ensures the strong consistency and high availability of the Storage Service. Store engine The bottom layer is the local storage engine library, providing operations like get , put , and scan on local disks. The related interfaces are stored in KVStore.h and KVEngine.h files. You can develop your own local store plugins based on your needs. The following will describe some features of the Storage Service based on the above architecture.","title":"The architecture of the Storage Service"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#storage_writing_process","text":"","title":"Storage writing process"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#kvstore","text":"NebulaGraph develops and customizes its built-in KVStore for the following reasons. It is a high-performance KVStore. It is provided as a (kv) library and can be easily developed for the filter pushdown purpose. As a strong-typed database, how to provide Schema during pushdown is the key to efficiency for NebulaGraph. It has strong data consistency. Therefore, NebulaGraph develops its own KVStore with RocksDB as the local storage engine. The advantages are as follows. For multiple local hard disks, NebulaGraph can make full use of its concurrent capacities through deploying multiple data directories. The Meta Service manages all the Storage servers. All the partition distribution data and current machine status can be found in the meta service. Accordingly, users can execute a manual load balancing plan in meta service. Note NebulaGraph does not support auto load balancing because auto data transfer will affect online business. NebulaGraph provides its own WAL mode so one can customize the WAL. Each partition owns its WAL. One NebulaGraph KVStore cluster supports multiple graph spaces, and each graph space has its own partition number and replica copies. Different graph spaces are isolated physically from each other in the same cluster.","title":"KVStore"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#data_storage_structure","text":"Graphs consist of vertices and edges. NebulaGraph uses key-value pairs to store vertices, edges, and their properties. Vertices and edges are stored in keys and their properties are stored in values. Such structure enables efficient property filtering. The storage structure of vertices Different from NebulaGraph version 2.x, version 3.x added a new key for each vertex. Compared to the old key that still exists, the new key has no TagID field and no value. Vertices in NebulaGraph can now live without tags owing to the new key. Field Description Type One byte, used to indicate the key type. PartID Three bytes, used to indicate the sharding partition and to scan the partition data based on the prefix when re-balancing the partition. VertexID The vertex ID. For an integer VertexID, it occupies eight bytes. However, for a string VertexID, it is changed to fixed_string of a fixed length which needs to be specified by users when they create the space. TagID Four bytes, used to indicate the tags that vertex relate with. SerializedValue The serialized value of the key. It stores the property information of the vertex. The storage structure of edges Field Description Type One byte, used to indicate the key type. PartID Three bytes, used to indicate the partition ID. This field can be used to scan the partition data based on the prefix when re-balancing the partition. VertexID Used to indicate vertex ID. The former VID refers to the source VID in the outgoing edge and the dest VID in the incoming edge, while the latter VID refers to the dest VID in the outgoing edge and the source VID in the incoming edge. Edge Type Four bytes, used to indicate the edge type. Greater than zero indicates out-edge, less than zero means in-edge. Rank Eight bytes, used to indicate multiple edges in one edge type.

When there are lots of edges and each has many properties, storage amplification will be obvious. The storage format of edges is shown in the figure below. In this example, SrcVertex connects DstVertex via EdgeA, forming the path of (SrcVertex)-[EdgeA]->(DstVertex) . SrcVertex, DstVertex, and EdgeA will all be stored in Partition x and Partition y as four key-value pairs in the storage layer. Details are as follows: The key value of SrcVertex is stored in Partition x. Key fields include Type, PartID(x), VID(Src), and TagID. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized vertex properties. The first key value of EdgeA, namely EdgeA_Out, is stored in the same partition as the SrcVertex. Key fields include Type, PartID(x), VID(Src), EdgeType(+ means out-edge), Rank(0), VID(Dst), and PlaceHolder. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized edge properties. The key value of DstVertex is stored in Partition y. Key fields include Type, PartID(y), VID(Dst), and TagID. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized vertex properties. The second key value of EdgeA, namely EdgeA_In, is stored in the same partition as the DstVertex. Key fields include Type, PartID(y), VID(Dst), EdgeType(- means in-edge), Rank(0), VID(Src), and PlaceHolder. SerializedValue, namely Value, refers to serialized edge properties, which is exactly the same as that in EdgeA_Out. EdgeA_Out and EdgeA_In are stored in storage layer with opposite directions, constituting EdgeA logically. EdgeA_Out is used for traversal requests starting from SrcVertex, such as (a)-[]->() ; EdgeA_In is used for traversal requests starting from DstVertex, such as ()-[]->(a) . Like EdgeA_Out and EdgeA_In, NebulaGraph redundantly stores the information of each edge, which doubles the actual capacities needed for edge storage. The key corresponding to the edge occupies a small hard disk space, but the space occupied by Value is proportional to the length and amount of the property value. Therefore, it will occupy a relatively large hard disk space if the property value of the edge is large or there are many edge property values.","title":"Edge partitioning and storage amplification"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#partition_algorithm","text":"NebulaGraph uses a static Hash strategy to shard data through a modulo operation on vertex ID. All the out-keys, in-keys, and tag data will be placed in the same partition. In this way, query efficiency is increased dramatically. Note The number of partitions needs to be determined when users are creating a graph space since it cannot be changed afterward. Users are supposed to take into consideration the demands of future business when setting it. When inserting into NebulaGraph, vertices and edges are distributed across different partitions. And the partitions are located on different machines. The number of partitions is set in the CREATE SPACE statement and cannot be changed afterward. If certain vertices need to be placed on the same partition (i.e., on the same machine), see Formula/code . The following code will briefly describe the relationship between VID and partition. // If VertexID occupies 8 bytes, it will be stored in int64 to be compatible with the version 1.0. uint64_t vid = 0; if (id.size() == 8) { memcpy(static_cast<void*>(&vid), id.data(), 8); } else { MurmurHash2 hash; vid = hash(id.data()); } PartitionID pId = vid % numParts + 1; Roughly speaking, after hashing a fixed string to int64, (the hashing of int64 is the number itself), do modulo, and then plus one, namely: pId = vid % numParts + 1 ; Parameters and descriptions of the preceding formula are as follows: Parameter Description % The modulo operation. numParts The number of partitions for the graph space where the VID is located, namely the value of partition_num in the CREATE SPACE statement. pId The ID for the partition where the VID is located. Suppose there are 100 partitions, the vertices with VID 1, 101, and 1001 will be stored on the same partition. But, the mapping between the partition ID and the machine address is random. Therefore, we cannot assume that any two partitions are located on the same machine.","title":"Partition algorithm"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#raft","text":"","title":"Raft"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#raft_implementation","text":"In a distributed system, one data usually has multiple replicas so that the system can still run normally even if a few copies fail. It requires certain technical means to ensure consistency between replicas. Basic principle: Raft is designed to ensure consistency between replicas. Raft uses election between replicas, and the (candidate) replica that wins more than half of the votes will become the Leader, providing external services on behalf of all replicas. The rest Followers will play backups. When the Leader fails (due to communication failure, operation and maintenance commands, etc.), the rest Followers will conduct a new round of elections and vote for a new Leader. The Leader and Followers will detect each other's survival through heartbeats and write them to the hard disk in Raft-wal mode. Replicas that do not respond to more than multiple heartbeats will be considered faulty. Note Raft-wal needs to be written into the hard disk periodically. If hard disk bottlenecks to write, Raft will fail to send a heartbeat and conduct a new round of elections. If the hard disk IO is severely blocked, there will be no Leader for a long time. Read and write: For every writing request of the clients, the Leader will initiate a Raft-wal and synchronize it with the Followers. Only after over half replicas have received the Raft-wal will it return to the clients successfully. For every reading request of the clients, it will get to the Leader directly, while Followers will not be involved. Failure: Scenario 1: Take a (space) cluster of a single replica as an example. If the system has only one replica, the Leader will be itself. If failure happens, the system will be completely unavailable. Scenario 2: Take a (space) cluster of three replicas as an example. If the system has three replicas, one of them will be the Leader and the rest will be the Followers. If the Leader fails, the rest two can still vote for a new Leader (and a Follower), and the system is still available. But if any of the two Followers fails again, the system will be completely unavailable due to inadequate voters. Note Raft and HDFS have different modes of duplication. Raft is based on a quorum vote, so the number of replicas cannot be even.","title":"Raft implementation"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#multi_group_raft","text":"The Storage Service supports a distributed cluster architecture, so NebulaGraph implements Multi Group Raft according to Raft protocol. Each Raft group stores all the replicas of each partition. One replica is the leader, while others are followers. In this way, NebulaGraph achieves strong consistency and high availability. The functions of Raft are as follows. NebulaGraph uses Multi Group Raft to improve performance when there are many partitions because Raft-wal cannot be NULL. When there are too many partitions, costs will increase, such as storing information in Raft group, WAL files, or batch operation in low load. There are two key points to implement the Multi Raft Group: To share transport layer Each Raft Group sends messages to its corresponding peers. So if the transport layer cannot be shared, the connection costs will be very high. To share thread pool Raft Groups share the same thread pool to prevent starting too many threads and a high context switch cost.","title":"Multi Group Raft"},{"location":"1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service/#batch","text":"For each partition, it is necessary to do a batch to improve throughput when writing the WAL serially.

In such a state, the quorum of the old group and new group always have an overlap. Thus it prevents the old or new group from making decisions unilaterally. To make it even simpler, in his doctoral thesis Diego Ongaro suggests adding or removing a peer once to ensure the overlap between the quorum of the new group and the old group. NebulaGraph also uses this approach, except that the way to add or remove a member is different.

However, DataNode used by HDFS ensures consistency through NameNode, which has no limit on the number of replicas. In the Storage Service, only the replicas of the leader can read and write, while in HDFS all the replicas can do so. In the Storage Service, the number of replicas needs to be determined when creating a space, since it cannot be changed afterward. But in HDFS, the number of replicas can be changed freely. The Storage Service can access the file system directly. While the applications of HDFS (such as HBase) have to access HDFS before the file system, which requires more RPC times. In a word, the Storage Service is more lightweight with some functions simplified and its architecture is simpler than HDFS, which can effectively improve the read and write performance of a smaller block of data.","title":"Differences with HDFS"},{"location":"14.client/1.nebula-client/","text":"Clients overview \u00b6 NebulaGraph supports multiple types of clients for users to connect to and manage the NebulaGraph database.

Using Docker Desktop Using Docker Compose NebulaGraph is available as a Docker Extension that you can easily install and run on your Docker Desktop. You can quickly deploy NebulaGraph using Docker Desktop with just one click. Install Docker Desktop Install Docker Desktop on Mac Install Docker Desktop on Windows Caution To install Docker Desktop, you need to install WSL 2 first. In the left sidebar of Docker Desktop, click Extensions or Add Extensions . On the Extensions Marketplace, search for NebulaGraph and click Install . Click Update to update NebulaGraph to the latest version when a new version is available. Click Open to navigate to the NebulaGraph extension page. At the top of the page, click Studio in Browser to use NebulaGraph. For more information about how to use NebulaGraph with Docker Desktop, see the following video: Using Docker Compose can quickly deploy NebulaGraph services based on the prepared configuration file. It is only recommended to use this method when testing the functions of NebulaGraph. Prerequisites \u00b6 You have installed the following applications on your host. Application Recommended version Official installation reference Docker Latest Install Docker Engine Docker Compose Latest Install Docker Compose Git Latest Download Git If you are deploying NebulaGraph as a non-root user, grant the user with Docker-related privileges. For detailed instructions, see Manage Docker as a non-root user . You have started the Docker service on your host. If you have already deployed another version of NebulaGraph with Docker Compose on your host, to avoid compatibility issues, you need to delete the nebula-docker-compose/data directory. For NebulaGraph Enterprise, you must have the license key loaded in LM . Deploy NebulaGraph \u00b6 Clone the 3.5.0 branch of the nebula-docker-compose repository to your host with Git. Danger The master branch contains the untested code for the latest NebulaGraph development release. DO NOT use this release in a production environment. $ git clone -b release-3.5 https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose.git Note The x.y version of Docker Compose aligns to the x.y version of NebulaGraph. For the NebulaGraph z version, Docker Compose does not publish the corresponding z version, but pulls the z version of the NebulaGraph image. Note For installation of the NebulaGraph enterprise version, contact us . Go to the nebula-docker-compose directory. $ cd nebula-docker-compose/ Configure License Manager address. Enterpriseonly Skip this step if you are using the community version. Edit the docker-compose.yml file. $ cd nebula-docker-compose/ $ vim docker-compose.yml Add the license_manager_url field under all services.metad{number}.command and set its value to the access address of LM. ... services : metad0 : command : - --license_manager_url=<LM_ADDR>:<LM_PORT> // <LM_ADDR> is the address of the LM service, and <LM_PORT> is the port of the LM service, which is 9119 by default. metad1 : command : - --license_manager_url=<LM_ADDR>:<LM_PORT> ...

To make the new configuration take effect, modify the configuration in this file and restart the service. For more instructions, see Configurations . FAQ \u00b6 How to fix the docker mapping to external ports? \u00b6 To set the ports of corresponding services as fixed mapping, modify the docker-compose.yaml in the nebula-docker-compose directory. For example: graphd: image: vesoft/nebula-graphd:release-3.5-snapchat ... ports: - 9669 :9669 - 19669 - 19670 9669:9669 indicates the internal port 9669 is uniformly mapped to external ports, while 19669 indicates the internal port 19669 is randomly mapped to external ports. How to upgrade or update the docker images of NebulaGraph services \u00b6 In the nebula-docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml file, change all the image values to the required image version. In the nebula-docker-compose directory, run docker-compose pull to update the images of the Graph Service, Storage Service, Meta Service, and NebulaGraph Console. Run docker-compose up -d to start the NebulaGraph services again. After connecting to NebulaGraph with NebulaGraph Console, run SHOW HOSTS GRAPH , SHOW HOSTS STORAGE , or SHOW HOSTS META to check the version of the responding service respectively. ERROR: toomanyrequests when docker-compose pull \u00b6 You may meet the following error. ERROR: toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit.

For more information, see nGQL guide . Graph space and NebulaGraph schema \u00b6 A NebulaGraph instance consists of one or more graph spaces. Graph spaces are physically isolated from each other. You can use different graph spaces in the same instance to store different datasets. To insert data into a graph space, define a schema for the graph database. NebulaGraph schema is based on the following components. Schema component Description Vertex Represents an entity in the real world. A vertex can have zero to multiple tags. Tag The type of the same group of vertices. It defines a set of properties that describes the types of vertices. Edge Represents a directed relationship between two vertices. Edge type The type of an edge. It defines a group of properties that describes the types of edges. For more information, see Data modeling . In this topic, we will use the following dataset to demonstrate basic CRUD operations. Async implementation of CREATE and ALTER \u00b6 Caution In NebulaGraph, the following CREATE or ALTER commands are implemented in an async way and take effect in the next heartbeat cycle. Otherwise, an error will be returned. To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds.

A GO traversal starts from one or more vertices, along one or more edges, and returns information in a form specified in the YIELD clause. The FETCH statement is used to get properties from vertices or edges. The LOOKUP statement is based on indexes . It is used together with the WHERE clause to search for the data that meet the specific conditions. The MATCH statement is the most commonly used statement for graph data querying. It can describe all kinds of graph patterns, but it relies on indexes to match data patterns in NebulaGraph.

Update vertices and edges \u00b6 Users can use the UPDATE or the UPSERT statements to update existing data. UPSERT is the combination of UPDATE and INSERT . If you update a vertex or an edge with UPSERT , the database will insert a new vertex or edge if it does not exist. Note UPSERT operates serially in a partition-based order. Therefore, it is slower than INSERT OR UPDATE . And UPSERT has concurrency only between multiple partitions. nGQL syntax \u00b6 UPDATE vertices: UPDATE VERTEX <vid> SET <properties to be updated> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]; UPDATE edges: UPDATE EDGE ON <edge_type> <source vid> -> <destination vid> [@rank] SET <properties to be updated> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns to be output>]; UPSERT vertices or edges: UPSERT {VERTEX <vid> | EDGE <edge_type>} SET <update_columns> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]; Examples \u00b6 UPDATE the name property of the vertex with VID player100 and check the result with the FETCH statement. nebula> UPDATE VERTEX \"player100\" SET player.name = \"Tim\"; nebula> FETCH PROP ON player \"player100\" YIELD properties(vertex); +------------------------+ | properties(VERTEX) | +------------------------+ | {age: 42, name: \"Tim\"} | +------------------------+ UPDATE the degree property of an edge and check the result with the FETCH statement. nebula> UPDATE EDGE ON follow \"player101\" -> \"player100\" SET degree = 96; nebula> FETCH PROP ON follow \"player101\" -> \"player100\" YIELD properties(edge); +------------------+ | properties(EDGE) | +------------------+ | {degree: 96} | +------------------+ Insert a vertex with VID player111 and UPSERT it. nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) VALUES \"player111\":(\"David West\", 38); nebula> UPSERT VERTEX \"player111\" SET player.name = \"David\", player.age = $^.player.age + 11 \\ WHEN $^.player.name == \"David West\" AND $^.player.age > 20 \\ YIELD $^.player.name AS Name, $^.player.age AS Age; +---------+-----+ | Name | Age | +---------+-----+ | \"David\" | 49 | +---------+-----+ Delete vertices and edges \u00b6 nGQL syntax \u00b6 Delete vertices: DELETE VERTEX <vid1>[, <vid2>...] Delete edges: DELETE EDGE <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>...] Examples \u00b6 Delete vertices: nebula> DELETE VERTEX \"player111\", \"team203\"; Delete edges: nebula> DELETE EDGE follow \"player101\" -> \"team204\"; About indexes \u00b6 Users can add indexes to tags and edge types with the CREATE INDEX statement. Must-read for using indexes Both MATCH and LOOKUP statements depend on the indexes. But indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance . DO NOT use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service. Users MUST rebuild indexes for pre-existing data. Otherwise, the pre-existing data cannot be indexed and therefore cannot be returned in MATCH or LOOKUP statements. For more information, see REBUILD INDEX . nGQL syntax \u00b6 Create an index: CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name> ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} ([<prop_name_list>]) [COMMENT = '<comment>']; Rebuild an index: REBUILD {TAG | EDGE} INDEX <index_name>; Note Define the index length when creating an index for a variable-length property. In UTF-8 encoding, a non-ascii character occupies 3 bytes. You should set an appropriate index length according to the variable-length property. For example, the index should be 30 bytes for 10 non-ascii characters. For more information, see CREATE INDEX Examples of LOOKUP and MATCH (index-based) \u00b6 Make sure there is an index for LOOKUP or MATCH to use. If there is not, create an index first. Find the information of the vertex with the tag player and its value of the name property is Tony Parker .

General queries statements \u00b6 MATCH MATCH <pattern> [<clause_1>] RETURN <output> [<clause_2>]; Pattern Example Description Match vertices (v) You can use a user-defined variable in a pair of parentheses to represent a vertex in a pattern. For example: (v) . Match tags MATCH (v:player) RETURN v You can specify a tag with :<tag_name> after the vertex in a pattern. Match multiple tags MATCH (v:player:team) RETURN v To match vertices with multiple tags, use colons (:). Match vertex properties MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v MATCH (v) WITH v, properties(v) as props, keys(properties(v)) as kk WHERE [i in kk where props[i] == \"Tim Duncan\"] RETURN v You can specify a vertex property with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} after the tag in a pattern; or use a vertex property value to get vertices directly. Match a VID. MATCH (v) WHERE id(v) == 'player101' RETURN v You can use the VID to match a vertex. The id() function can retrieve the VID of a vertex. Match multiple VIDs. MATCH (v:player { name: 'Tim Duncan' })--(v2) WHERE id(v2) IN [\"player101\", \"player102\"] RETURN v2 To match multiple VIDs, use WHERE id(v) IN [vid_list] . Match connected vertices MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})--(v2) RETURN v2.player.name AS Name You can use the -- symbol to represent edges of both directions and match vertices connected by these edges. You can add a > or < to the -- symbol to specify the direction of an edge. Match paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-->(v2) RETURN p Connected vertices and edges form a path. You can use a user-defined variable to name a path as follows. Match edges MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]-(v2) RETURN e MATCH ()<-[e]-() RETURN e Besides using -- , --> , or <-- to indicate a nameless edge, you can use a user-defined variable in a pair of square brackets to represent a named edge. For example: -[e]- . Match an edge type MATCH ()-[e:follow]-() RETURN e Just like vertices, you can specify an edge type with :<edge_type> in a pattern. For example: -[e:follow]- . Match edge type properties MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow{degree:95}]->(v2) RETURN e MATCH ()-[e]->() WITH e, properties(e) as props, keys(properties(e)) as kk WHERE [i in kk where props[i] == 90] RETURN e You can specify edge type properties with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} in a pattern. For example: [e:follow{likeness:95}] ; or use an edge type property value to get edges directly. Match multiple edge types MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | :serve]->(v2) RETURN e The | symbol can help matching multiple edge types. For example: [e:follow|:serve] . The English colon (:) before the first edge type cannot be omitted, but the English colon before the subsequent edge type can be omitted, such as [e:follow|serve] . Match multiple edges MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2)<-[e:serve]-(v3) RETURN v2, v3 You can extend a pattern to match multiple edges in a path. Match fixed-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends You can use the :<edge_type>*<hop> pattern to match a fixed-length path. hop must be a non-negative integer. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*1..3]->(v2) RETURN v2 AS Friends minHop : Optional. It represents the minimum length of the path. minHop : must be a non-negative integer. The default value is 1. minHop and maxHop are optional and the default value is 1 and infinity respectively. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths with multiple edge types MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | serve*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 You can specify multiple edge types in a fixed-length or variable-length pattern. In this case, hop , minHop , and maxHop take effect on all edge types. The data type of e is the list. Retrieve vertex or edge information MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->(v2) RETURN e Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>} to retrieve all the information of a vertex or an edge. Retrieve VIDs MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN id(v) Use the id() function to retrieve VIDs. Retrieve tags MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN labels(v) Use the labels() function to retrieve the list of tags on a vertex. To retrieve the nth element in the labels(v) list, use labels(v)[n-1] . Retrieve a single property on a vertex or an edge MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v.player.age Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>}.<property> to retrieve a single property. Use AS to specify an alias for a property. Retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2) RETURN properties(v2) Use the properties() function to retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge. Retrieve edge types MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->() RETURN DISTINCT type(e) Use the type() function to retrieve the matched edge types. Retrieve paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[*3]->() RETURN p Use RETURN <path_name> to retrieve all the information of the matched paths. Retrieve vertices in a path MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2) RETURN nodes(p) Use the nodes() function to retrieve all vertices in a path. Retrieve edges in a path MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2) RETURN relationships(p) Use the relationships() function to retrieve all edges in a path. Retrieve path length MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[*..2]->(v2) RETURN p AS Paths, length(p) AS Length Use the length() function to retrieve the length of a path.

List functions Function Description keys(expr) Returns a list containing the string representations for all the property names of vertices, edges, or maps. labels(vertex) Returns the list containing all the tags of a vertex. nodes(path) Returns the list containing all the vertices in a path. range(start, end [, step]) Returns the list containing all the fixed-length steps in [start,end] . step is 1 by default. relationships(path) Returns the list containing all the relationships in a path. reverse(list) Returns the list reversing the order of all elements in the original list. tail(list) Returns all the elements of the original list, excluding the first one. head(list) Returns the first element of a list. last(list) Returns the last element of a list. reduce() The reduce() function applies an expression to each element in a list one by one, chains the result to the next iteration by taking it as the initial value, and returns the final result. Type conversion functions Function Description bool toBoolean() Converts a string value to a boolean value. float toFloat() Converts an integer or string value to a floating point number. string toString() Converts non-compound types of data, such as numbers, booleans, and so on, to strings. int toInteger() Converts a floating point or string value to an integer value. set toSet() Converts a list or set value to a set value. int hash() The hash() function returns the hash value of the argument. The argument can be a number, a string, a list, a boolean, null, or an expression that evaluates to a value of the preceding data types. Predicate functions Predicate functions return true or false . They are most commonly used in WHERE clauses. <predicate>(<variable> IN <list> WHERE <condition>) Function Description exists() Returns true if the specified property exists in the vertex, edge or map. Otherwise, returns false . any() Returns true if the specified predicate holds for at least one element in the given list. Otherwise, returns false . all() Returns true if the specified predicate holds for all elements in the given list. Otherwise, returns false . none() Returns true if the specified predicate holds for no element in the given list. Otherwise, returns false . single() Returns true if the specified predicate holds for exactly one of the elements in the given list. Otherwise, returns false . Conditional expressions functions Function Description CASE The CASE expression uses conditions to filter the result of an nGQL query statement. It is usually used in the YIELD and RETURN clauses. The CASE expression will traverse all the conditions. When the first condition is met, the CASE expression stops reading the conditions and returns the result. If no conditions are met, it returns the result in the ELSE clause. If there is no ELSE clause and no conditions are met, it returns NULL . coalesce() Returns the first not null value in all expressions.","title":"Functions"},{"location":"2.quick-start/6.cheatsheet-for-ngql/#general_queries_statements","text":"MATCH MATCH <pattern> [<clause_1>] RETURN <output> [<clause_2>]; Pattern Example Description Match vertices (v) You can use a user-defined variable in a pair of parentheses to represent a vertex in a pattern. For example: (v) . Match tags MATCH (v:player) RETURN v You can specify a tag with :<tag_name> after the vertex in a pattern. Match multiple tags MATCH (v:player:team) RETURN v To match vertices with multiple tags, use colons (:). Match vertex properties MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v MATCH (v) WITH v, properties(v) as props, keys(properties(v)) as kk WHERE [i in kk where props[i] == \"Tim Duncan\"] RETURN v You can specify a vertex property with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} after the tag in a pattern; or use a vertex property value to get vertices directly. Match a VID. MATCH (v) WHERE id(v) == 'player101' RETURN v You can use the VID to match a vertex. The id() function can retrieve the VID of a vertex. Match multiple VIDs. MATCH (v:player { name: 'Tim Duncan' })--(v2) WHERE id(v2) IN [\"player101\", \"player102\"] RETURN v2 To match multiple VIDs, use WHERE id(v) IN [vid_list] . Match connected vertices MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})--(v2) RETURN v2.player.name AS Name You can use the -- symbol to represent edges of both directions and match vertices connected by these edges. You can add a > or < to the -- symbol to specify the direction of an edge. Match paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-->(v2) RETURN p Connected vertices and edges form a path. You can use a user-defined variable to name a path as follows. Match edges MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]-(v2) RETURN e MATCH ()<-[e]-() RETURN e Besides using -- , --> , or <-- to indicate a nameless edge, you can use a user-defined variable in a pair of square brackets to represent a named edge. For example: -[e]- . Match an edge type MATCH ()-[e:follow]-() RETURN e Just like vertices, you can specify an edge type with :<edge_type> in a pattern. For example: -[e:follow]- . Match edge type properties MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow{degree:95}]->(v2) RETURN e MATCH ()-[e]->() WITH e, properties(e) as props, keys(properties(e)) as kk WHERE [i in kk where props[i] == 90] RETURN e You can specify edge type properties with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} in a pattern. For example: [e:follow{likeness:95}] ; or use an edge type property value to get edges directly. Match multiple edge types MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | :serve]->(v2) RETURN e The | symbol can help matching multiple edge types. For example: [e:follow|:serve] . The English colon (:) before the first edge type cannot be omitted, but the English colon before the subsequent edge type can be omitted, such as [e:follow|serve] . Match multiple edges MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2)<-[e:serve]-(v3) RETURN v2, v3 You can extend a pattern to match multiple edges in a path. Match fixed-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends You can use the :<edge_type>*<hop> pattern to match a fixed-length path. hop must be a non-negative integer. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*1..3]->(v2) RETURN v2 AS Friends minHop : Optional. It represents the minimum length of the path. minHop : must be a non-negative integer. The default value is 1. minHop and maxHop are optional and the default value is 1 and infinity respectively. The data type of e is the list. Match variable-length paths with multiple edge types MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | serve*2]->(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 You can specify multiple edge types in a fixed-length or variable-length pattern. In this case, hop , minHop , and maxHop take effect on all edge types. The data type of e is the list. Retrieve vertex or edge information MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->(v2) RETURN e Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>} to retrieve all the information of a vertex or an edge. Retrieve VIDs MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN id(v) Use the id() function to retrieve VIDs. Retrieve tags MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN labels(v) Use the labels() function to retrieve the list of tags on a vertex. To retrieve the nth element in the labels(v) list, use labels(v)[n-1] . Retrieve a single property on a vertex or an edge MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v.player.age Use RETURN {<vertex_name> | <edge_name>}.<property> to retrieve a single property. Use AS to specify an alias for a property. Retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2) RETURN properties(v2) Use the properties() function to retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge. Retrieve edge types MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]->() RETURN DISTINCT type(e) Use the type() function to retrieve the matched edge types. Retrieve paths MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[*3]->() RETURN p Use RETURN <path_name> to retrieve all the information of the matched paths. Retrieve vertices in a path MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2) RETURN nodes(p) Use the nodes() function to retrieve all vertices in a path. Retrieve edges in a path MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]->(v2) RETURN relationships(p) Use the relationships() function to retrieve all edges in a path. Retrieve path length MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[*..2]->(v2) RETURN p AS Paths, length(p) AS Length Use the length() function to retrieve the length of a path. OPTIONAL MATCH Pattern Example Description Matches patterns against your graph database, just like MATCH does. MATCH (m)-[]->(n) WHERE id(m)==\"player100\" OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[]->(l) RETURN id(m),id(n),id(l) If no matches are found, OPTIONAL MATCH will use a null for missing parts of the pattern. LOOKUP LOOKUP ON {<vertex_tag> | <edge_type>} [WHERE <expression> [AND <expression> ...]] YIELD <return_list> [AS <alias>] Pattern Example Description Retrieve vertices LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == \"Tony Parker\" YIELD player.name AS name, player.age AS age The following example returns vertices whose name is Tony Parker and the tag is player . Retrieve edges LOOKUP ON follow WHERE follow.degree == 90 YIELD follow.degree Returns edges whose degree is 90 and the edge type is follow .

You can use the search box in the help center or the search function of the browser to match the questions you are looking for. If the solutions described in this topic cannot solve your problems, ask for help on the NebulaGraph forum or submit an issue on GitHub issue . About manual updates \u00b6 \"Why is the behavior in the manual not consistent with the system?\" \u00b6 NebulaGraph is still under development. Its behavior changes from time to time. Users can submit an issue to inform the team if the manual and the system are not consistent. Note If you find some errors in this topic: Click the pencil button at the top right side of this page. Use markdown to fix this error. Then click \"Commit changes\" at the bottom, which will start a Github pull request. Sign the CLA . This pull request will be merged after the acceptance of at least two reviewers. About legacy version compatibility \u00b6 X version compatibility Neubla Graph 3.5.0 is not compatible with NebulaGraph 1.x nor 2.0-RC in both data formats and RPC-protocols, and vice versa . The service process may quit if using an lower version client to connect to a higher version server. To upgrade data formats, see Upgrade NebulaGraph to the current version . Users must upgrade all clients . About execution errors \u00b6 \"How to resolve the error -1005:GraphMemoryExceeded: (-2600) ?\" \u00b6 This error is issued by the Memory Tracker when it observes that memory usage has exceeded a set threshold. This mechanism can help avoid service processes from being terminated by the system's OOM (Out of Memory) killer. Steps to resolve: Check memory usage: First, you need to check the memory usage during the execution of the command. If the memory usage is indeed high, then this error might be expected. Check the configuration of the Memory Tracker: If the memory usage is not high, check the relevant configurations of the Memory Tracker. These include memory_tracker_untracked_reserved_memory_mb (untracked reserved memory in MB), memory_tracker_limit_ratio (memory limit ratio), and memory_purge_enabled (whether memory purge is enabled). For the configuration of the Memory Tracker, see memory tracker configuration . Optimize configurations: Adjust these configurations according to the actual situation. For example, if the available memory limit is too low, you can increase the value of memory_tracker_limit_ratio . \"How to resolve the error SemanticError: Missing yield clause. ?\" \u00b6 Starting with NebulaGraph 3.0.0, the statements LOOKUP , GO , and FETCH must output results with the YIELD clause. For more information, see YIELD . \"How to resolve the error Host not enough! ?\" \u00b6 From NebulaGraph version 3.0.0, the Storage services added in the configuration files CANNOT be read or written directly. The configuration files only register the Storage services into the Meta services. You must run the ADD HOSTS command to read and write data on Storage servers. For more information, see Manage Storage hosts . \"How to resolve the error To get the property of the vertex in 'v.age', should use the format 'var.tag.prop' ?\" \u00b6 From NebulaGraph version 3.0.0, patterns support matching multiple tags at the same time, so you need to specify a tag name when querying properties. The original statement RETURN variable_name.property_name is changed to RETURN variable_name.<tag_name>.property_name . \"How to resolve the error Storage Error E_RPC_FAILURE ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error is usually that the storaged process returns too many data back to the graphd process. Possible solutions are as follows: Modify configuration files : Modify the value of --storage_client_timeout_ms in the nebula-graphd.conf file to extend the connection timeout of the Storage client. This configuration is measured in milliseconds (ms). For example, set --storage_client_timeout_ms=60000 . If this parameter is not specified in the nebula-graphd.conf file, specify it manually. Tip: Add --local_config=true at the beginning of the configuration file and restart the service. Optimize the query statement: Reduce queries that scan the entire database. No matter whether LIMIT is used to limit the number of returned results, use the GO statement to rewrite the MATCH statement (the former is optimized, while the latter is not). Check whether the Storaged process has OOM. ( dmesg |grep nebula ). Use better SSD or memory for the Storage Server. Retry. \"How to resolve the error The leader has changed. Try again later ?\" \u00b6 It is a known issue. Just retry 1 to N times, where N is the partition number. The reason is that the meta client needs some heartbeats to update or errors to trigger the new leader information. If this error occurs when logging in to NebulaGraph, you can consider using df -h to view the disk space and check whether the local disk is full. Unable to download SNAPSHOT packages when compiling Exchange, Connectors, or Algorithm \u00b6 Problem description: The system reports Could not find artifact com.vesoft:client:jar:xxx-SNAPSHOT when compiling. Cause: There is no local Maven repository for storing or downloading SNAPSHOT packages. The default central repository in Maven only stores official releases, not development versions (SNAPSHOTs). Solution: Add the following configuration in the profiles scope of Maven's setting.xml file: <profile> <activation> <activeByDefault> true </activeByDefault> </activation> <repositories> <repository> <id> snapshots </id> <url> https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ </url> <snapshots> <enabled> true </enabled> </snapshots> </repository> </repositories> </profile> \"How to resolve [ERROR (-1004)]: SyntaxError: syntax error near ?\" \u00b6 In most cases, a query statement requires a YIELD or a RETURN . Check your query statement to see if YIELD or RETURN is provided. \"How to resolve the error can\u2019t solve the start vids from the sentence ?\" \u00b6 The graphd process requires start vids to begin a graph traversal. The start vids can be specified by the user. For example: > GO FROM ${vids} ... > MATCH (src) WHERE id(src) == ${vids} # The \"start vids\" are explicitly given by ${vids}. It can also be found from a property index. For example: # CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS i_player ON player(name(20)); # REBUILD TAG INDEX i_player; > LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == \"abc\" | ... YIELD ... > MATCH (src) WHERE src.name == \"abc\" ... # The \"start vids\" are found from the property index \"name\". Otherwise, an error like can\u2019t solve the start vids from the sentence will be returned. \"How to resolve the error Wrong vertex id type: 1001 ?\" \u00b6 Check whether the VID is INT64 or FIXED_STRING(N) set by create space . For more information, see create space . \"How to resolve the error The VID must be a 64-bit integer or a string fitting space vertex id length limit. ?\" \u00b6 Check whether the length of the VID exceeds the limitation. For more information, see create space . \"How to resolve the error edge conflict or vertex conflict ?\" \u00b6 NebulaGraph may return such errors when the Storage service receives multiple requests to insert or update the same vertex or edge within milliseconds. Try the failed requests again later. \"How to resolve the error RPC failure in MetaClient: Connection refused ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error is usually that the metad service status is unusual, or the network of the machine where the metad and graphd services are located is disconnected. Possible solutions are as follows: Check the metad service status on the server where the metad is located. If the service status is unusual, restart the metad service. Use telnet meta-ip:port to check the network status under the server that returns an error. Check the port information in the configuration file. If the port is different from the one used when connecting, use the port in the configuration file or modify the configuration. \"How to resolve the error StorageClientBase.inl:214] Request to \"x.x.x.x\":9779 failed: N6apache6thrift9transport19TTransportExceptionE: Timed Out in nebula-graph.INFO ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error may be that the amount of data to be queried is too large, and the storaged process has timed out. Possible solutions are as follows: When importing data, set Compaction manually to make read faster. Extend the RPC connection timeout of the Graph service and the Storage service. Modify the value of --storage_client_timeout_ms in the nebula-graphd.conf file. This configuration is measured in milliseconds (ms). The default value is 60000ms. \"How to resolve the error MetaClient.cpp:65] Heartbeat failed, status:Wrong cluster! in nebula-storaged.INFO , or HBProcessor.cpp:54] Reject wrong cluster host \"x.x.x.x\":9771! in nebula-metad.INFO ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error may be that the user has modified the IP or the port information of the metad process, or the storage service has joined other clusters before. Possible solutions are as follows: Delete the cluster.id file in the installation directory where the storage machine is deployed (the default installation directory is /usr/local/nebula ), and restart the storaged service. \"How to resolve the error Storage Error: More than one request trying to add/update/delete one edge/vertex at he same time. ?\" \u00b6 The reason for this error is that the current NebulaGraph version does not support concurrent requests to the same vertex or edge at the same time. To solve this error, re-execute your commands. About design and functions \u00b6 \"How is the time spent value at the end of each return message calculated?\" \u00b6 Take the returned message of SHOW SPACES as an example: nebula> SHOW SPACES; +--------------------+ | Name | +--------------------+ | \"basketballplayer\" | +--------------------+ Got 1 rows (time spent 1235/1934 us) The first number 1235 shows the time spent by the database itself, that is, the time it takes for the query engine to receive a query from the client, fetch the data from the storage server, and perform a series of calculations. The second number 1934 shows the time spent from the client's perspective, that is, the time it takes for the client from sending a request, receiving a response, and displaying the result on the screen. \"Why does the port number of the nebula-storaged process keep showing red after connecting to NebulaGraph?\" \u00b6 Because the nebula-storaged process waits for nebula-metad to add the current Storage service during the startup process. The Storage works after it receives the ready signal. Starting from NebulaGraph 3.0.0, the Meta service cannot directly read or write data in the Storage service that you add in the configuration file. The configuration file only registers the Storage service to the Meta service. You must run the ADD HOSTS command to enable the Meta to read and write data in the Storage service. For more information, see Manage Storage hosts . \"Why is there no line separating each row in the returned result of NebulaGraph 2.6.0?\" \u00b6 This is caused by the release of NebulaGraph Console 2.6.0, not the change of NebulaGraph core. And it will not affect the content of the returned data itself. About dangling edges \u00b6 A dangling edge is an edge that only connects to a single vertex and only one part of the edge connects to the vertex. Dangling edges may appear in NebulaGraph 3.5.0 as the design. And there is no MERGE statements of openCypher. The guarantee for dangling edges depends entirely on the application level. For more information, see INSERT VERTEX , DELETE VERTEX , INSERT EDGE , DELETE EDGE . \"Can I set replica_factor as an even number in CREATE SPACE statements, e.g., replica_factor = 2 ?\" \u00b6 NO. The Storage service guarantees its availability based on the Raft consensus protocol. The number of failed replicas must not exceed half of the total replica number. When the number of machines is 1, replica_factor can only be set to 1 . When there are enough machines and replica_factor=2 , if one replica fails, the Storage service fails. No matter replica_factor=3 or replica_factor=4 , if more than one replica fails, the Storage Service fails. To prevent unnecessary waste of resources, we recommend that you set an odd replica number. We suggest that you set replica_factor=3 for a production environment and replica_factor=1 for a test environment. Do not use an even number. \"Is stopping or killing slow queries supported?\" \u00b6 Yes. For more information, see Kill query . \"Why are the query results different when using GO and MATCH to execute the same semantic query?\" \u00b6 The possible reasons are listed as follows. GO statements find the dangling edges. RETURN commands do not specify the sequence. The dense vertex truncation limitation defined by max_edge_returned_per_vertex in the Storage service is triggered. Using different types of paths may cause different query results. GO statements use walk . Both vertices and edges can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. MATCH statements are compatible with openCypher and use trail . Only vertices can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. The example is as follows. All queries that start from A with 5 hops will end at C ( A->B->C->D->E->C ). If it is 6 hops, the GO statement will end at D ( A->B->C->D->E->C->D ), because the edge C->D can be visited repeatedly. However, the MATCH statement returns empty, because edges cannot be visited repeatedly. Therefore, using GO and MATCH to execute the same semantic query may cause different query results. For more information, see Wikipedia . \"How to count the vertices/edges number of each tag/edge type?\" \u00b6 See show-stats . \"How to get all the vertices/edge of each tag/edge type?\" \u00b6 Create and rebuild the index. > CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS i_player ON player(); > REBUILD TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS i_player; Use LOOKUP or MATCH . For example: > LOOKUP ON player; > MATCH (n:player) RETURN n; For more information, see INDEX , LOOKUP , and MATCH . \"Can non-English characters be used as identifiers, such as the names of graph spaces, tags, edge types, properties, and indexes?\" \u00b6 Yes, for more information, see Keywords and reserved words . \"How to get the out-degree/the in-degree of a given vertex?\" \u00b6 The out-degree of a vertex refers to the number of edges starting from that vertex, while the in-degree refers to the number of edges pointing to that vertex. nebula > MATCH (s)-[e]->() WHERE id(s) == \"given\" RETURN count(e); #Out-degree nebula > MATCH (s)<-[e]-() WHERE id(s) == \"given\" RETURN count(e); #In-degree This is a very slow operation to get the out/in degree since no accelaration can be applied (no indices or caches). It also could be out-of-memory when hitting a supper-node . \"How to quickly get the out-degree and in-degree of all vertices?\" \u00b6 There is no such command. You can use NebulaGraph Algorithm . About operation and maintenance \u00b6 \"The runtime log files are too large. How to recycle the logs?\" \u00b6 By default, the runtime logs of NebulaGraph are stored in /usr/local/nebula/logs/ . The INFO level log files are nebula-graphd.INFO, nebula-storaged.INFO, nebula-metad.INFO . If an alarm or error occurs, the suffixes are modified as .WARNING or .ERROR . NebulaGraph uses glog to print logs. glog cannot recycle the outdated files. To rotate logs, you can: Use crontab to delete logs periodically. For more information, see Glog should delete old log files automatically . Use logrotate to manage log files. Before using logrotate, modify the configurations of corresponding services and set timestamp_in_logfile_name to false . \"How to check the NebulaGraph version?\" \u00b6 If the service is running: run command SHOW HOSTS META in nebula-console . See SHOW HOSTS . If the service is not running: Different installation methods make the method of checking the version different. The instructions are as follows: If the service is not running, run the command ./<binary_name> --version to get the version and the Git commit IDs of the NebulaGraph binary files. For example: $ ./nebula-graphd --version If you deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose Check the version of NebulaGraph deployed by Docker Compose. The method is similar to the previous method, except that you have to enter the container first. The commands are as follows: docker exec -it nebula-docker-compose_graphd_1 bash cd bin/ ./nebula-graphd --version If you install NebulaGraph with RPM/DEB package Run rpm -qa |grep nebula to check the version of NebulaGraph. \"How to scale my cluster up/down or out/in?\" \u00b6 Enterpriseonly The cluster scaling function has not been officially released in the community edition. The operations involving SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA REMOVE and SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA are experimental features in the community edition and the functionality is not stable. Before using it in the community edition, make sure to back up your data first and set enable_experimental_feature and enable_data_balance to true in the Graph configuration file . Increase or decrease the number of Meta, Graph, or Storage nodes \u00b6 NebulaGraph 3.5.0 does not provide any commands or tools to support automatic scale out/in. You can refer to the following steps: Scale out and scale in metad: The metad process can not be scaled out or scale in. The process cannot be moved to a new machine. You cannot add a new metad process to the service. Note You can use the Meta transfer script tool to migrate Meta services. Note that the Meta-related settings in the configuration files of Storage and Graph services need to be modified correspondingly. Scale in graphd: Remove the IP of the graphd process from the code in the client. Close this graphd process. Scale out graphd: Prepare the binary and config files of the graphd process in the new host. Modify the config files and add all existing addresses of the metad processes. Then start the new graphd process. Scale in storaged: See Balance remove command . After the command is finished, stop this storaged process. Caution Before executing this command to migrate the data in the specified Storage node, make sure that the number of other Storage nodes is sufficient to meet the set replication factor. For example, if the replication factor is set to 3, then before executing this command, make sure that the number of other Storage nodes is greater than or equal to 3. If there are multiple space partitions in the Storage node to be migrated, execute this command in each space to migrate all space partitions in the Storage node. Scale out storaged: Prepare the binary and config files of the storaged process in the new host, Modify the config files and add all existing addresses of the metad processes. Then register the storaged process to the metad, and then start the new storaged process. For details, see Register storaged services . You also need to run Balance Data and Balance leader after scaling in/out storaged. You can scale Graph and Storage services with Dashboard Enterprise Edition. For details, see Scale . You can also use NebulaGraph Operator to scale Graph and Storage services. For details, see Deploy NebulaGraph clusters with Kubectl and Deploy NebulaGraph clusters with Helm . Add or remove disks in the Storage nodes \u00b6 Currently, Storage cannot dynamically recognize new added disks. You can add or remove disks in the Storage nodes of the distributed cluster by following these steps: Execute SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA REMOVE <ip:port> to migrate data in the Storage node with the disk to be added or removed to other Storage nodes. Caution Before executing this command to migrate the data in the specified Storage node, make sure that the number of other Storage nodes is sufficient to meet the set replication factor. For example, if the replication factor is set to 3, then before executing this command, make sure that the number of other Storage nodes is greater than or equal to 3. If there are multiple space partitions in the Storage node to be migrated, execute this command in each space to migrate all space partitions in the Storage node. Execute DROP HOSTS <ip:port> to remove the Storage node with the disk to be added or removed. In the configuration file of all Storage nodes, configure the path of the new disk to be added or removed through --data_path , see Storage configuration file for details. Execute ADD HOSTS <ip:port> to re-add the Storage node with the disk to be added or removed. As needed, execute SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA to evenly distribute the shards of the current space to all Storage nodes and execute SUBMIT JOB BALANCE LEADER command to balance the leaders in all spaces. Before running the command, select a space. \"After changing the name of the host, the old one keeps displaying OFFLINE . What should I do?\" \u00b6 Hosts with the status of OFFLINE will be automatically deleted after one day. \"How do I view the dmp file?\" \u00b6 The dmp file is an error report file detailing the exit of the process and can be viewed with the gdb utility. the Coredump file is saved in the directory of the startup binary (by default it is /usr/local/nebula ) and is generated automatically when the NebulaGraph service crashes. Check the Core file process name, pid is usually a numeric value. $ file core.<pid> Use gdb to debug. $ gdb <process.name> core.<pid> View the contents of the file. $(gdb) bt For example: $ file core.1316027 core.1316027: ELF 64-bit LSB core file, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style, from '/home/workspace/fork/nebula-debug/bin/nebula-metad --flagfile /home/k', real uid: 1008, effective uid: 1008, real gid: 1008, effective gid: 1008, execfn: '/home/workspace/fork/nebula-debug/bin/nebula-metad', platform: 'x86_64' $ gdb /home/workspace/fork/nebula-debug/bin/nebula-metad core.1316027 $(gdb) bt #0 0x00007f9de58fecf5 in __memcpy_ssse3_back () from /lib64/libc.so.6 #1 0x0000000000eb2299 in void std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >::_M_construct<char*>(char*, char*, std::forward_iterator_tag) () #2 0x0000000000ef71a7 in nebula::meta::cpp2::QueryDesc::QueryDesc(nebula::meta::cpp2::QueryDesc const&) () ... If you are not clear about the information that dmp prints out, you can post the printout with the OS version, hardware configuration, error logs before and after the Core file was created and actions that may have caused the error on the NebulaGraph forum . How can I set the NebulaGraph service to start automatically on boot via systemctl? \u00b6 Execute systemctl enable to start the metad, graphd and storaged services.

MATCH statements are compatible with openCypher and use trail . Only vertices can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. The example is as follows. All queries that start from A with 5 hops will end at C ( A->B->C->D->E->C ). If it is 6 hops, the GO statement will end at D ( A->B->C->D->E->C->D ), because the edge C->D can be visited repeatedly.

These jobs can be time-consuming if the data amount in the graph space is large. The job manager helps you run, show, stop, and recover jobs. Note All job management commands can be executed only after selecting a graph space. SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA \u00b6 Enterpriseonly Only available for the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition. Caution Before performing the job, it is recommended to create a snapshot . During job execution, do not execute other jobs, such as SUBMIT JOB STATS , REBUILD INDEX , etc. During job execution, it is recommended not to write or read data in large batches. The SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA statement starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 28 | +------------+ SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA REMOVE \u00b6 Enterpriseonly Only available for the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition. Starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in the current graph space. The default port is 9779 . It returns the job ID. For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA REMOVE 192.168.8.100:9779; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 29 | +------------+ SUBMIT JOB BALANCE LEADER \u00b6 Starts a job to balance the distribution of all the storage leaders in all graph spaces. It returns the job ID. For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE LEADER; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 33 | +------------+ SUBMIT JOB COMPACT \u00b6 The SUBMIT JOB COMPACT statement triggers the long-term RocksDB compact operation in the current graph space. For more information about compact configuration, see Storage Service configuration . For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB COMPACT; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 40 | +------------+ SUBMIT JOB FLUSH \u00b6 The SUBMIT JOB FLUSH statement writes the RocksDB memfile in the memory to the hard disk in the current graph space. For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB FLUSH; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 96 | +------------+ SUBMIT JOB STATS \u00b6 The SUBMIT JOB STATS statement starts a job that makes the statistics of the current graph space. Once this job succeeds, you can use the SHOW STATS statement to list the statistics. For more information, see SHOW STATS . Note If the data stored in the graph space changes, in order to get the latest statistics, you have to run SUBMIT JOB STATS again. For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB STATS; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 9 | +------------+ SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD/INGEST \u00b6 The SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS and SUBMIT JOB INGEST commands are used to import the SST file into NebulaGraph. For detail, see Import data from SST files . The SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS command will download the SST file on the specified HDFS. The SUBMIT JOB INGEST command will import the downloaded SST file into NebulaGraph. For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS \"hdfs://192.168.10.100:9000/sst\"; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 10 | +------------+ nebula> SUBMIT JOB INGEST; +------------+ | New Job Id | +------------+ | 11 | +------------+ SHOW JOB \u00b6 The Meta Service parses a SUBMIT JOB request into multiple tasks and assigns them to the nebula-storaged processes. The SHOW JOB <job_id> statement shows the information about a specific job and all its tasks in the current graph space. job_id is returned when you run the SUBMIT JOB statement. For example: nebula> SHOW JOB 9; +----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+ | Job Id(TaskId) | Command(Dest) | Status | Start Time | Stop Time | Error Code | +----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+ | 8 | \"STATS\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2022-10-18T08:14:45.000000 | 2022-10-18T08:14:45.000000 | \"SUCCEEDED\" | | 0 | \"192.168.8.129\" | \"FINISHED\" | 2022-10-18T08:14:45.000000 | 2022-10-18T08:15:13.000000 | \"SUCCEEDED\" | | \"Total:1\" | \"Succeeded:1\" | \"Failed:0\" | \"In Progress:0\" | \"\" | \"\" | +----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+ The descriptions are as follows.

Command(Dest) The first row shows the command executed and the other rows show on which storaged processes the task is running. The last row shows the number of successful tasks related to the job. Status Shows the status of the job or task. The last row shows the number of failed tasks related to the job. For more information, see Job status . Start Time Shows a timestamp indicating the time when the job or task enters the RUNNING phase. The last row shows the number of ongoing tasks related to the job. Stop Time Shows a timestamp indicating the time when the job or task gets FINISHED , FAILED , or STOPPED . Error Code The error code of job. Job status \u00b6 The descriptions are as follows. Status Description QUEUE The job or task is waiting in a queue. The Start Time is empty in this phase. RUNNING The job or task is running. The Start Time shows the beginning time of this phase. FINISHED The job or task is successfully finished. The Stop Time shows the time when the job or task enters this phase. FAILED The job or task has failed. The Stop Time shows the time when the job or task enters this phase. STOPPED The job or task is stopped without running. The Stop Time shows the time when the job or task enters this phase. REMOVED The job or task is removed. The description of switching the status is described as follows. Queue -- running -- finished -- removed \\ \\ / \\ \\ -- failed -- / \\ \\ / \\ ---------- stopped -/ SHOW JOBS \u00b6 The SHOW JOBS statement lists all the unexpired jobs in the current graph space. The default job expiration interval is one week. You can change it by modifying the job_expired_secs parameter of the Meta Service.

This topic will describe the patterns in NebulaGraph, some of which have not yet been implemented. Patterns for vertices \u00b6 A vertex is described using a pair of parentheses and is typically given a name. For example: (a) This simple pattern describes a single vertex and names that vertex using the variable a . Patterns for related vertices \u00b6 A more powerful construct is a pattern that describes multiple vertices and edges between them. Patterns describe an edge by employing an arrow between two vertices. For example: (a)-[]->(b) This pattern describes a very simple data structure: two vertices and a single edge from one to the other. In this example, the two vertices are named as a and b respectively and the edge is directed : it goes from a to b . This manner of describing vertices and edges can be extended to cover an arbitrary number of vertices and the edges between them, for example: (a)-[]->(b)<-[]-(c) Such a series of connected vertices and edges is called a path . Note that the naming of the vertices in these patterns is only necessary when one needs to refer to the same vertex again, either later in the pattern or elsewhere in the query. If not, the name may be omitted as follows: (a)-[]->()<-[]-(c) Patterns for tags \u00b6 Note The concept of tag in nGQL has a few differences from that of label in openCypher. For example, users must create a tag before using it. And a tag also defines the type of properties. In addition to simply describing the vertices in the graphs, patterns can also describe the tags of the vertices. For example: (a:User)-[]->(b) Patterns can also describe a vertex that has multiple tags. For example: (a:User:Admin)-[]->(b) Patterns for properties \u00b6 Vertices and edges are the fundamental elements in a graph. In nGQL, properties are added to them for richer models. In the patterns, the properties can be expressed as follows: some key-value pairs are enclosed in curly brackets and separated by commas, and the tag or edge type to which a property belongs must be specified. For example, a vertex with two properties will be like: (a:player{name: \"Tim Duncan\", age: 42}) One of the edges that connect to this vertex can be like: (a)-[e:follow{degree: 95}]->(b) Patterns for edges \u00b6 The simplest way to describe an edge is by using the arrow between two vertices, as in the previous examples. Users can describe an edge and its direction using the following statement. If users do not care about its direction, the arrowhead can be omitted. For example: (a)-[]-(b) Like vertices, edges can also be named. A pair of square brackets will be used to separate the arrow and the variable will be placed between them. For example: (a)-[r]->(b) Like the tags on vertices, edges can also have types. To describe an edge with a specific type, use the pattern as follows: (a)-[r:REL_TYPE]->(b) An edge can only have one edge type. But if we'd like to describe some data such that the edge could have a set of types, then they can all be listed in the pattern, separating them with the pipe symbol | like this: (a)-[r:TYPE1|TYPE2]->(b) Like vertices, the name of an edge can be omitted. For example: (a)-[:REL_TYPE]->(b) Variable-length pattern \u00b6 Rather than describing a long path using a sequence of many vertex and edge descriptions in a pattern, many edges (and the intermediate vertices) can be described by specifying a length in the edge description of a pattern. For example: (a)-[*2]->(b) The following pattern describes a graph of three vertices and two edges, all in one path (a path of length 2). It is equivalent to: (a)-[]->()-[]->(b) The range of lengths can also be specified. Such edge patterns are called variable-length edges . For example: (a)-[*3..5]->(b) The preceding example defines a path with a minimum length of 3 and a maximum length of 5. It describes a graph of either 4 vertices and 3 edges, 5 vertices and 4 edges, or 6 vertices and 5 edges, all connected in a single path. The lower bound can be omitted. For example, to describe paths of length 5 or less, use: (a)-[*..5]->(b) Note The upper bound must be specified. The following are NOT accepted. (a)-[*3..]->(b) (a)-[*]->(b) Assigning to path variables \u00b6 As described above, a series of connected vertices and edges is called a path . nGQL allows paths to be named using variables. For example: p = (a)-[*3..5]->(b) Users can do this in the MATCH statement.","title":"Graph patterns"},{"location":"3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/3.graph-patterns/#patterns","text":"Patterns and graph pattern matching are the very heart of a graph query language.

In this example, the two vertices are named as a and b respectively and the edge is directed : it goes from a to b . This manner of describing vertices and edges can be extended to cover an arbitrary number of vertices and the edges between them, for example: (a)-[]->(b)<-[]-(c) Such a series of connected vertices and edges is called a path .

To use special characters, reserved keywords, or start with a number in a tag name, enclose them in backticks (`), and do not use periods ( . ) in a tag name.

CREATE EDGE [IF NOT EXISTS] <edge_type_name> ( <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>'] [{, <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']} ...] ) [TTL_DURATION = <ttl_duration>] [TTL_COL = <prop_name>] [COMMENT = '<comment>']; Parameter Description IF NOT EXISTS Detects if the edge type that you want to create exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The edge type existence detection here only compares the edge type names (excluding properties). <edge_type_name> 1. The edge type name must be unique in a graph space. 2. Once the edge type name is set, it can not be altered. 3. Edge type names cannot start with a number; they support 1-4 byte UTF-8 encoded characters, including English letters (case sensitive), numbers, Chinese characters, etc., but do not include special characters other than underscores. To use special characters, reserved keywords or starting with a number, quote them with backticks (`) and cannot use periods ( . ). For more information, see Keywords and reserved words . Note : If you name an edge type in Chinese and encounter a SyntaxError , you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (`). <prop_name> The name of the property. It must be unique for each edge type. The rules for permitted property names are the same as those for edge type names. <data_type> Shows the data type of each property. For a full description of the property data types, see Data types and Boolean . NULL \\| NOT NULL Specifies if the property supports NULL | NOT NULL . The default value is NULL . DEFAULT must be specified if NOT NULL is set. DEFAULT Specifies a default value for a property. The default value can be a literal value or an expression supported by NebulaGraph. If no value is specified, the default value is used when inserting a new edge. COMMENT The remarks of a certain property or the edge type itself. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on an edge type. TTL_DURATION Specifies the life cycle for the property. The property that exceeds the specified TTL expires. The expiration threshold is the TTL_COL value plus the TTL_DURATION . The default value of TTL_DURATION is 0 . It means the data never expires. TTL_COL Specifies the property to set a timeout on. The data type of the property must be int or timestamp . An edge type can only specify one field as TTL_COL . For more information on TTL, see TTL options .

For how to create tags or edge types, see CREATE TAG and CREATE EDGE . For how to create full-text indexes, see Deploy full-text index . Must-read for using indexes \u00b6 The concept and using restrictions of indexes are comparatively complex. Before you use indexes, you must read the following sections carefully. You can use CREATE INDEX to add native indexes for the existing tags, edge types, or properties. They are usually called as tag indexes, edge type indexes, and property indexes. Tag indexes and edge type indexes apply to queries related to the tag and the edge type, but do not apply to queries that are based on certain properties on the tag. For example, you can use LOOKUP to retrieve all the vertices with the tag player . Property indexes apply to property-based queries. For example, you can use the age property to retrieve the VID of all vertices that meet age == 19 . If a property index i_TA is created for the property A of the tag T and i_T for the tag T , the indexes can be replaced as follows (the same for edge type indexes): The query engine can use i_TA to replace i_T . In the MATCH and LOOKUP statements, i_T may replace i_TA for querying properties. Legacy version compatibility In previous releases, the tag or edge type index in the LOOKUP statement cannot replace the property index for property queries. Although the same results can be obtained by using alternative indexes for queries, the query performance varies according to the selected index. Caution Indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance can be greatly reduced . DO NOT use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service. Indexes cannot make queries faster. It can only locate a vertex or an edge according to properties or count the number of vertices or edges. Long indexes decrease the scan performance of the Storage Service and use more memory. We suggest that you set the indexing length the same as that of the longest string to be indexed. The longest index length is 256 bytes. Steps \u00b6 If you must use indexes, we suggest that you: Import the data into NebulaGraph. Create indexes. Rebuild indexes . After the index is created and the data is imported, you can use LOOKUP or MATCH to retrieve the data. You do not need to specify which indexes to use in a query, NebulaGraph figures that out by itself. Note If you create an index before importing the data, the importing speed will be extremely slow due to the reduction in the write performance. Keep --disable_auto_compaction = false during daily incremental writing. The newly created index will not take effect immediately. Trying to use a newly created index (such as LOOKUP or REBUILD INDEX ) may fail and return can't find xxx in the space because the creation is implemented asynchronously. To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds. To change the heartbeat interval, modify the heartbeat_interval_secs in the configuration files for all services. Danger After creating a new index, or dropping the old index and creating a new one with the same name again, you must REBUILD INDEX . Otherwise, these data cannot be returned in the MATCH and LOOKUP statements. Syntax \u00b6 CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name> ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} ([<prop_name_list>]) [COMMENT '<comment>']; Parameter Description TAG | EDGE Specifies the index type that you want to create. IF NOT EXISTS Detects if the index that you want to create exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created. <index_name> The name of the index. It must be unique in a graph space. A recommended way of naming is i_tagName_propName . Index names cannot start with a number. They supports 1 to 4 bytes UTF-8 encoded characters, such as English letters (case-sensitive), numbers, and Chinese characters, but does not support special characters except underscores. To use special characters, reserved keywords, or starting with a number, quote them with backticks. For more information, see Keywords and reserved words . Note : If you name an index in Chinese and encounter a SyntaxError , you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (`). <tag_name> | <edge_name> Specifies the name of the tag or edge associated with the index. <prop_name_list> To index a variable-length string property, you must use prop_name(length) to specify the index length. To index a tag or an edge type, ignore the prop_name_list . COMMENT The remarks of the index. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on an index. Create tag/edge type indexes \u00b6 nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS player_index on player(); nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS follow_index on follow(); After indexing a tag or an edge type, you can use the LOOKUP statement to retrieve the VID of all vertices with the tag , or the source vertex ID, destination vertex ID, and ranks of all edges with the edge type .

Note If you create an index before importing the data, the importing speed will be extremely slow due to the reduction in the write performance. Keep --disable_auto_compaction = false during daily incremental writing. The newly created index will not take effect immediately. Trying to use a newly created index (such as LOOKUP or REBUILD INDEX ) may fail and return can't find xxx in the space because the creation is implemented asynchronously. To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds. To change the heartbeat interval, modify the heartbeat_interval_secs in the configuration files for all services. Danger After creating a new index, or dropping the old index and creating a new one with the same name again, you must REBUILD INDEX . Otherwise, these data cannot be returned in the MATCH and LOOKUP statements.","title":"Steps"},{"location":"3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/1.create-native-index/#syntax","text":"CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name> ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} ([<prop_name_list>]) [COMMENT '<comment>']; Parameter Description TAG | EDGE Specifies the index type that you want to create.

If not specified, the properties will be hidden. step_count specifies the number of hops from the source vertices and returns the subgraph from 0 to step_count hops. It must be a non-negative integer. Its default value is 1. vid specifies the vertex IDs. edge_type specifies the edge type. You can use IN , OUT , and BOTH to specify the traversal direction of the edge type. The default is BOTH . <WHERE clause> specifies the filter conditions for the traversal, which can be used with the boolean operator AND . YIELD defines the output that needs to be returned. You can return only vertices or edges. A column alias must be set. Note The path type of GET SUBGRAPH is trail . Only vertices can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. For more information, see Path . Limitations \u00b6 While using the WHERE clause in a GET SUBGRAPH statement, note the following restrictions: Only support the AND operator. Only support filter destination vertex, the vertex format must be $$.tagName.propName . Support filter edge, the edge format must be edge_type.propName . Support math functions, aggregate functions, string functions, datetime functions, type conversion functions and general functions in list functions.

PROFILE executes the statement, then outputs the execution plan as well as the execution profile. You can optimize the queries for better performance according to the execution plan and profile. Execution Plan \u00b6 The execution plan is determined by the execution planner in the NebulaGraph query engine. The execution planner processes the parsed nGQL statements into actions . An action is the smallest unit that can be executed. A typical action fetches all neighbors of a given vertex, gets the properties of an edge, and filters vertices or edges based on the given conditions. Each action is assigned to an operator that performs the action. For example, a SHOW TAGS statement is processed into two actions and assigned to a Start operator and a ShowTags operator , while a more complex GO statement may be processed into more than 10 actions and assigned to 10 operators.

Precautions \u00b6 While inserting time-type property values with DATE , TIME , and DATETIME , NebulaGraph transforms them to a UTC time according to the timezone specified with the timezone_name parameter in the configuration files . Note To change the timezone, modify the timezone_name value in the configuration files of all NebulaGraph services. date() , time() , and datetime() can convert a time-type property with a specified timezone. For example, datetime(\"2017-03-04 22:30:40.003000+08:00\") or datetime(\"2017-03-04T22:30:40.003000[Asia/Shanghai]\") . date() , time() , datetime() , and timestamp() all accept empty parameters to return the current date, time, and datetime. date() , time() , and datetime() all accept the property name to return a specific property value of itself. For example, date().month returns the current month, while time(\"02:59:40\").minute returns the minutes of the importing time. For time operations it is recommended to use duration() to calculate the offset of the moment. Addition and subtraction of date() and date() , timestamp() and timestamp() are also supported. When setting the year of the time as a negative number, you need to use Map type data. OpenCypher Compatibility \u00b6 In nGQL: Year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, and microsecond are supported, while the nanosecond is not supported. localdatetime() is not supported. Most string time formats are not supported. The exceptions are YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss and YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss . The single-digit string time format is supported. For example, time(\"1:1:1\") . DATE \u00b6 The DATE type is used for values with a date part but no time part. Nebula Graph retrieves and displays DATE values in the YYYY-MM-DD format. The supported range is -32768-01-01 to 32767-12-31 . The properties of date() include year , month , and day . date() supports the input of YYYYY , YYYYY-MM or YYYYY-MM-DD , and defaults to 01 for an untyped month or day. nebula> RETURN DATE({year:-123, month:12, day:3}); +------------------------------------+ | date({year:-(123),month:12,day:3}) | +------------------------------------+ | -123-12-03 | +------------------------------------+ nebula> RETURN DATE(\"23333\"); +---------------+ | date(\"23333\") | +---------------+ | 23333-01-01 | +---------------+ nebula> RETURN DATE(\"2023-12-12\") - DATE(\"2023-12-11\"); +-----------------------------------------+ | (date(\"2023-12-12\")-date(\"2023-12-11\")) | +-----------------------------------------+ | 1 | +-----------------------------------------+ TIME \u00b6 The TIME type is used for values with a time part but no date part.

It has a range of 1970-01-01T00:00:01 UTC to 2262-04-11T23:47:16 UTC. TIMESTAMP has the following features: Stored and displayed in the form of a timestamp, such as 1615974839 , which means 2021-03-17T17:53:59 . Supported TIMESTAMP querying methods: timestamp and timestamp() function. Supported TIMESTAMP inserting methods: timestamp, timestamp() function, and now() function. timestamp() function accepts empty arguments to get the current timestamp. It can pass an integer arguments to identify the integer as a timestamp and the range of passed integer is: 0~9223372036 \u3002 timestamp() function can convert DATETIME to TIMESTAMP , and the data type of DATETIME should be a string .

They then use filters, group-bys, or sorting before returning the combined return results. Nebula Graph supports three methods to run composite queries (or sub-queries): (openCypher) Clauses are chained together, and they feed intermediate result sets between each other. (Native nGQL) More than one query can be batched together, separated by semicolons (;). The result of the last query is returned as the result of the batch. (Native nGQL) Queries can be piped together by using the pipe ( | ). The result of the previous query can be used as the input of the next query. OpenCypher compatibility \u00b6 In a composite query, do not put together openCypher and native nGQL clauses in one statement. For example, this statement is undefined: MATCH ... | GO ... | YIELD ... . If you are in the openCypher way ( MATCH , RETURN , WITH , etc), do not introduce any pipe or semicolons to combine the sub-clauses. If you are in the native nGQL way ( FETCH , GO , LOOKUP , etc), you must use pipe or semicolons to combine the sub-clauses. Composite queries are not transactional queries (as in SQL/Cypher) \u00b6 For example, a query is composed of three sub-queries: A B C , A | B | C or A; B; C . In that A is a read operation, B is a computation operation, and C is a write operation. If any part fails in the execution, the whole result will be undefined. There is no rollback. What is written depends on the query executor. Note OpenCypher has no requirement of transaction .

By defining one or more patterns, you can search for data that matches the patterns in NebulaGraph. Once the matching data is retrieved, you can use the RETURN clause to return it as a result. The examples in this topic use the basketballplayer dataset as the sample dataset. Syntax \u00b6 The syntax of MATCH is relatively more flexible compared with that of other query statements such as GO or LOOKUP . The path type of the MATCH statement is trail . That is, only vertices can be repeatedly visited in the graph traversal. Edges cannot be repeatedly visited. For details, see path . But generally, it can be summarized as follows. MATCH <pattern> [<clause_1>] RETURN <output> [<clause_2>]; pattern : The MATCH statement supports matching one or multiple patterns. Multiple patterns are separated by commas (,). For example: (a)-[]->(b),(c)-[]->(d) . For the detailed description of patterns, see Patterns . clause_1 : The WHERE , WITH , UNWIND , and OPTIONAL MATCH clauses are supported, and the MATCH clause can also be used. output : Define the list name for the output results to be returned. You can use AS to set an alias for the list. clause_2 : The ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses are supported. Legacy version compatibility Starting from version 3.5.0, the MATCH statement supports full table scans. It can traverse vertices or edges in the graph without using any indexes or filter conditions. In previous versions, the MATCH statement required an index for certain queries or needed to use LIMIT to restrict the number of output results. Starting from NebulaGraph version 3.0.0, in order to distinguish the properties of different tags, you need to specify a tag name when querying properties. The original statement RETURN <variable_name>.<property_name> is changed to RETURN <variable_name>.<tag_name>.<property_name> . Notes \u00b6 Avoid full table scans, as they may result in decreased query performance, and if there is insufficient memory during a full table scan, the query may fail, and the system will report an error. It is recommended to use queries with filter conditions or specifying tags and edge types, such as v:player and v.player.name in the statement MATCH (v:player) RETURN v.player.name AS Name . You can create an index for a tag, edge type, or a specific property of a tag or edge type to improve query performance. For example, you can create an index for the player tag or the name property of the player tag. For more information about the usage and considerations for indexes, see Must-read for using indexes . The MATCH statement cannot query dangling edges. Using patterns in MATCH statements \u00b6 Match vertices \u00b6 You can use a user-defined variable in a pair of parentheses to represent a vertex in a pattern. For example: (v) . nebula> MATCH (v) \\ RETURN v \\ LIMIT 3; +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | v | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ | (\"player102\" :player{age: 33, name: \"LaMarcus Aldridge\"}) | | (\"player106\" :player{age: 25, name: \"Kyle Anderson\"}) | | (\"player115\" :player{age: 40, name: \"Kobe Bryant\"}) | +-----------------------------------------------------------+ Match tags \u00b6 Legacy version compatibility In NebulaGraph versions earlier than 3.0.0, the prerequisite for matching a tag is that the tag itself has an index or a certain property of the tag has an index. Starting from NebulaGraph 3.0.0, you can match tags without creating an index, but you need to use LIMIT to restrict the number of output results. Starting from NebulaGraph 3.5.0, the MATCH statement supports full table scans. There is no need to create an index for a tag or a specific property of a tag, nor use LIMIT to restrict the number of output results in order to execute the MATCH statement.

For example: -[e:follow]- . OpenCypher compatibility In NebulaGraph versions earlier than 3.0.0, the prerequisite for matching a edge type is that the edge type itself has an index or a certain property of the edge type has an index. Starting from version 3.0.0, there is no need to create an index for matching a edge type, but you need to use LIMIT to limit the number of output results and you must specify the direction of the edge. Starting from NebulaGraph 3.5.0, you can use the MATCH statement to match edges without creating an index for edge type or using LIMIT to restrict the number of output results. nebula> MATCH ()-[e:follow]->() \\ RETURN e; +----------------------------------------------------+ | e | +----------------------------------------------------+ | [:follow \"player102\"->\"player100\" @0 {degree: 75}] | | [:follow \"player102\"->\"player101\" @0 {degree: 75}] | | [:follow \"player129\"->\"player116\" @0 {degree: 90}] | ... Match edge type properties \u00b6 Note The prerequisite for matching an edge type property is that the edge type itself has an index of the corresponding property. Otherwise, you cannot execute the MATCH statement to match the property. You can specify edge type properties with {<prop_name>: <prop_value>} in a pattern.

If not specified, the default value for N is one . When N is zero , NebulaGraph does not traverse any edges and returns nothing. Note The path type of the GO statement is walk , which means both vertices and edges can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. For more information, see Path . M TO N {STEP|STEPS} : traverses from M to N hops. When M is zero , the output is the same as that of M is one . That is, the output of GO 0 TO 2 and GO 1 TO 2 are the same. <vertex_list> : represents a list of vertex IDs separated by commas. <edge_type_list> : represents a list of edge types which the traversal can go through. REVERSELY | BIDIRECT : defines the direction of the query. By default, the GO statement searches for outgoing edges of <vertex_list> . If REVERSELY is set, GO searches for incoming edges. If BIDIRECT is set, GO searches for edges of both directions. The direction of the query can be checked by returning the <edge_type>._type field using YIELD . A positive value indicates an outgoing edge, while a negative value indicates an incoming edge. WHERE <expression> : specifies the traversal filters. You can use the WHERE clause for the source vertices, the edges, and the destination vertices. You can use it together with AND , OR , NOT , and XOR . For more information, see WHERE . Note There are some restrictions for the WHERE clause when you traverse along with multiple edge types. For example, WHERE edge1.prop1 > edge2.prop2 is not supported. The GO statement is executed by traversing all the vertices and then filtering according to the filter condition. YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list> : defines the output to be returned. It is recommended to use the Schema-related functions to fill in <return_list> . src(edge) , dst(edge) , type(edge) ) , rank(edge) , etc., are currently supported, while nested functions are not. For more information, see YIELD . SAMPLE <sample_list> : takes samples from the result set. For more information, see SAMPLE . <limit_by_list_clause> : limits the number of outputs during the traversal process. For more information, see LIMIT . GROUP BY : groups the output into subgroups based on the value of the specified property. For more information, see GROUP BY . After grouping, you need to use YIELD again to define the output that needs to be returned. ORDER BY : sorts outputs with specified orders. For more information, see ORDER BY . Note When the sorting method is not specified, the output orders can be different for the same query. LIMIT [<offset>,] <number_rows>] : limits the number of rows of the output. For more information, see LIMIT . Notes \u00b6 The WHERE and YIELD clauses in GO statements usually utilize property reference symbols ( $^ and $$ ) or the properties($^) and properties($$) functions to specify the properties of a vertex; use the properties(edge) function to specify the properties of an edge.

You can use LOOKUP for the following purposes: Search for the specific data based on conditions defined by the WHERE clause. List vertices with a tag: retrieve the VID of all vertices with a tag. List edges with an edge type: retrieve the source vertex IDs, destination vertex IDs, and ranks of all edges with an edge type. Count the number of vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type. OpenCypher compatibility \u00b6 This topic applies to native nGQL only. Precautions \u00b6 Correct use of indexes can speed up queries, but indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance can be greatly reduced . DO NOT use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service. If the specified property is not indexed when using the LOOKUP statement, NebulaGraph randomly selects one of the available indexes. For example, the tag player has two properties, name and age . Both the tag player itself and the property name have indexes, but the property age has no indexes. When running LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.age == 36 YIELD player.name; , NebulaGraph randomly uses one of the indexes of the tag player and the property name . You can use the EXPLAIN statement to check the selected index. Legacy version compatibility Before the release 2.5.0, if the specified property is not indexed when using the LOOKUP statement, NebulaGraph reports an error and does not use other indexes. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before using the LOOKUP statement, make sure that at least one index is created. If there are already related vertices, edges, or properties before an index is created, the user must rebuild the index after creating the index to make it valid. Syntax \u00b6 LOOKUP ON {<vertex_tag> | <edge_type>} [WHERE <expression> [AND <expression> ...]] YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list> [AS <alias>]; <return_list> <prop_name> [AS <col_alias>] [, <prop_name> [AS <prop_alias>] ...]; WHERE <expression> : filters data with specified conditions. Both AND and OR are supported between different expressions. For more information, see WHERE . YIELD : Define the output to be returned. For details, see YIELD . DISTINCT : Aggregate the output results and return the de-duplicated result set. AS : Set an alias. Limitations of using WHERE in LOOKUP \u00b6 The WHERE clause in a LOOKUP statement does not support the following operations: $- and $^ . Filter rank() . In relational expressions, operators are not supported to have field names on both sides, such as tagName.prop1> tagName.prop2 . Nested AliasProp expressions in operation expressions and function expressions are not supported. The XOR operation is not supported. String operations other than STARTS WITH are not supported.

The usage of LIMIT in native nGQL statements and openCypher compatible statements is different. Native nGQL: Generally, a pipe | needs to be used before the LIMIT clause. The offset parameter can be set or omitted directly after the LIMIT statement. OpenCypher compatible statements: No pipes are permitted before the LIMIT clause.

General LIMIT syntax in native nGQL statements \u00b6 In native nGQL, the general LIMIT syntax works the same as in SQL . The LIMIT clause accepts one or two parameters. The values of both parameters must be non-negative integers and be used after a pipe. The syntax and description are as follows: ... | LIMIT [<offset>,] <number_rows>; Parameter Description offset The offset value. It defines the row from which to start returning. The offset starts from 0 . The default value is 0 , which returns from the first row. number_rows It constrains the total number of returned rows.

Syntax: <go_statement> LIMIT <limit_list>; limit_list is a list.

The following takes GO 1 TO 3 STEPS FROM \"A\" OVER * LIMIT <limit_list> as an example to introduce this usage of LIMIT in detail. The list limit_list must contain 3 natural numbers, such as GO 1 TO 3 STEPS FROM \"A\" OVER * LIMIT [1,2,4] . 1 in LIMIT [1,2,4] means that the system automatically selects 1 edge to continue traversal in the first step. 2 means to select 2 edges to continue traversal in the second step. 4 indicates that 4 edges are selected to continue traversal in the third step. Because GO 1 TO 3 STEPS means to return all the traversal results from the first to third steps, all the red edges and their source and destination vertices in the figure below will be matched by this GO statement. And the yellow edges represent there is no path selected when the GO statement traverses. If it is not GO 1 TO 3 STEPS but GO 3 STEPS , it will only match the red edges of the third step and the vertices at both ends.

Once timed out, the property expires. OpenCypher Compatibility \u00b6 This topic applies to native nGQL only. Precautions \u00b6 You CANNOT modify a property schema with TTL options on it. TTL options and indexes have coexistence issues. TTL options and indexes CANNOT coexist on a tag or an edge type. If there is an index on a property, you cannot set TTL options on other properties. If there are TTL options on a tag, an edge type, or a property, you can still add an index on them. TTL options \u00b6 The native nGQL TTL feature has the following options. Option Description ttl_col Specifies the property to set a timeout on. The data type of the property must be int or timestamp . ttl_duration Specifies the timeout adds-on value in seconds. The value must be a non-negative int64 number. A property expires if the sum of its value and the ttl_duration value is smaller than the current timestamp. If the ttl_duration value is 0 , the property never expires. You can set ttl_use_ms to true in the configuration file nebula-storaged.conf (default path: /usr/local/nightly/etc/ ) to set the default unit to milliseconds. Caution Before setting ttl_use_ms to true , make sure that no TTL has been set for any property, as shortening the expiration time may cause data to be erroneously deleted. After setting ttl_use_ms to true , which sets the default TTL unit to milliseconds, the data type of the property specified by ttl_col must be int , and the property value needs to be manually converted to milliseconds. For example, when setting ttl_col to a , you need to convert the value of a to milliseconds, such as when the value of a is now() , you need to set the value of a to now() * 1000 . Data expiration and deletion \u00b6 Caution When the TTL options are set for a property of a tag or an edge type and the property's value is NULL , the property never expires. If a property with a default value of now() is added to a tag or an edge type and the TTL options are set for the property, the history data related to the tag or the edge type will never expire because the value of that property for the history data is the current timestamp. Vertex property expiration \u00b6 Vertex property expiration has the following impact. If a vertex has only one tag, once a property of the vertex expires, the vertex expires. If a vertex has multiple tags, once a property of the vertex expires, properties bound to the same tag with the expired property also expire, but the vertex does not expire and other properties of it remain untouched. Edge property expiration \u00b6 Since an edge can have only one edge type, once an edge property expires, the edge expires. Data deletion \u00b6 The expired data are still stored on the disk, but queries will filter them out. NebulaGraph automatically deletes the expired data and reclaims the disk space during the next compaction . Note If TTL is disabled , the corresponding data deleted after the last compaction can be queried again. Use TTL options \u00b6 You must use the TTL options together to set a valid timeout on a property. Set a timeout if a tag or an edge type exists \u00b6 If a tag or an edge type is already created, to set a timeout on a property bound to the tag or edge type, use ALTER to update the tag or edge type. # Create a tag. nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS t1 (a timestamp); # Use ALTER to update the tag and set the TTL options. nebula> ALTER TAG t1 TTL_COL = \"a\", TTL_DURATION = 5; # Insert a vertex with tag t1.

Drop the property with the timeout. nebula> ALTER TAG t1 DROP (a); Set ttl_col to an empty string. nebula> ALTER TAG t1 TTL_COL = \"\"; Set ttl_duration to 0 .

If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The graph space existence detection here only compares the graph space name (excluding properties). <graph_space_name> 1. Uniquely identifies a graph space in a NebulaGraph instance. 2. Space names cannot be modified after they are set. 3. Space names cannot start with a number; they support 1-4 byte UTF-8 encoded characters, including English letters (case sensitive), numbers, Chinese characters, etc., but do not include special characters other than underscores. To use special characters, reserved keywords or starting with a number, quote them with backticks (`) and cannot use periods ( . ). For more information, see Keywords and reserved words . Note : If you name a space in Chinese and encounter a SyntaxError , you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (`). partition_num Specifies the number of partitions in each replica. The suggested value is 20 times (2 times for HDD) the number of the hard disks in the cluster. For example, if you have three hard disks in the cluster, we recommend that you set 60 partitions. The default value is 100. replica_factor Specifies the number of replicas in the cluster. The suggested number is 3 in a production environment and 1 in a test environment. The replica number must be an odd number for the need of quorum-based voting. The default value is 1. vid_type A required parameter. Specifies the VID type in a graph space. Available values are FIXED_STRING(N) and INT64 . INT equals to INT64 . `FIXED_STRING(<N>) specifies the VID as a string, while INT64 specifies it as an integer. N represents the maximum length of the VIDs. If you set a VID that is longer than N bytes, NebulaGraph throws an error. Note, for UTF-8 chars, the length may vary in different cases, i.e. a UTF-8 Chinese char is 3 byte, this means 11 Chinese chars(length-33) will exeed a FIXED_STRING(32) vid defination. COMMENT The remarks of the graph space. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there is no comments on a space. Caution If the replica number is set to one, you will not be able to load balance or scale out the NebulaGraph Storage Service with the SUBMIT JOB BALANCE statement. Restrictions on VID type change and VID length: For NebulaGraph v1.x, the type of VIDs can only be INT64 , and the String type is not allowed. For NebulaGraph v2.x, both INT64 and FIXED_STRING(<N>) VID types are allowed. You must specify the VID type when creating a graph space, and use the same VID type in INSERT statements, otherwise, an error message Wrong vertex id type: 1001 occurs. The length of the VID should not be longer than N characters. If it exceeds N , NebulaGraph throws The VID must be a 64-bit integer or a string fitting space vertex id length limit. . If the Host not enough! error appears, the immediate cause is that the number of online storage hosts is less than the value of replica_factor specified when creating a graph space. In this case, you can use the SHOW HOSTS command to see if the following situations occur: For the case where there is only one storage host in a cluster, the value of replica_factor can only be specified to 1 . Or create a graph space after storage hosts are scaled out. A new storage host is found, but ADD HOSTS is not executed to activate it. In this case, run SHOW HOSTS to locate the new storage host information and then run ADD HOSTS to activate it. A graph space can be created after there are enough storage hosts. For offline storage hosts after running SHOW HOSTS , troubleshooting is needed. Legacy version compatibility For NebulaGraph v2.x before v2.5.0, vid_type is optional and defaults to FIXED_STRING(8) . Note graph_space_name , partition_num , replica_factor , vid_type , and comment cannot be modified once set. To modify them, drop the current working graph space with DROP SPACE and create a new one with CREATE SPACE . Clone graph spaces \u00b6 CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] <new_graph_space_name> AS <old_graph_space_name>; Parameter Description IF NOT EXISTS Detects if the new graph space exists. If it does not exist, the new one will be created. The graph space existence detection here only compares the graph space name (excluding properties). <new_graph_space_name> The name of the graph space that is newly created. The name of the graph space starts with a letter, supports 1 to 4 bytes UTF-8 encoded characters, such as English letters (case-sensitive), digits, and Chinese characters, but does not support special characters except underscores. For more information, see Keywords and reserved words . When a new graph space is created, the schema of the old graph space <old_graph_space_name> will be cloned, including its parameters (the number of partitions and replicas, etc.), Tag, Edge type and native indexes. <old_graph_space_name> The name of the graph space that already exists.

Process Suggested number metad (the metadata service process) 3 storaged (the storage service process) 3 or more graphd (the query engine service process) 3 or more Each metad process automatically creates and maintains a replica of the metadata. Usually, you need to deploy three metad processes and only three. The number of storaged processes does not affect the number of graph space replicas.

Resource Unit How to estimate Description Disk space for a cluster Bytes the_sum_of_edge_number_and_vertex_number * average_bytes_of_properties * 7.5 * 120% For more information, see Edge partitioning and storage amplification . Memory for a cluster Bytes [ the_sum_of_edge_number_and_vertex_number * 16 + the_number_of_RocksDB_instances * ( write_buffer_size * max_write_buffer_number ) + rocksdb_block_cache ] * 120% write_buffer_size and max_write_buffer_number are RocksDB parameters. For more information, see MemTable . For details about rocksdb_block_cache , see Memory usage in RocksDB . Number of partitions for a graph space - the_number_of_disks_in_the_cluster * disk_partition_num_multiplier disk_partition_num_multiplier is an integer between 2 and 20 (both including). Its value depends on the disk performance. Use 20 for SSD and 2 for HDD. Question 1: Why do I need to multiply by 7.5 in the disk space estimation formula? Answer: On one hand, the data in one single replica takes up about 2.5 times more space than that of the original data file (csv) according to test values. On the other hand, indexes take up additional space. Each indexed vertex or edge takes up 16 bytes of memory. The hard disk space occupied by the index can be empirically estimated as the total number of indexed vertices or edges * 50 bytes. Question 2: Why do we multiply the disk space and memory by 120%? Answer: The extra 20% is for buffer. Question 3: How to get the number of RocksDB instances? Answer: Each graph space corresponds to one RocksDB instance and each directory in the --data_path item in the etc/nebula-storaged.conf file corresponds to one RocksDB instance. That is, the number of RocksDB instances = the number of directories * the number of graph spaces. Note Users can decrease the memory size occupied by the bloom filter by adding --enable_partitioned_index_filter=true in etc/nebula-storaged.conf . But it may decrease the read performance in some random-seek cases. Caution Each RocksDB instance takes up about 70M of disk space even when no data has been written yet. One partition corresponds to one RocksDB instance, and when the partition setting is very large, for example, 100, the graph space takes up a lot of disk space after it is created.","title":"Resource preparations"},{"location":"4.deployment-and-installation/1.resource-preparations/#prepare_resources_for_compiling_installing_and_running_nebulagraph","text":"This topic describes the requirements and suggestions for compiling and installing NebulaGraph, as well as how to estimate the resource you need to reserve for running a NebulaGraph cluster.

In standalone NebulaGraph, the three processes corresponding to the three services are combined into one process. For more information about NebulaGraph, see Architecture overview . Scenarios \u00b6 Small data sizes and low availability requirements. For example, test environments that are limited by the number of machines, scenarios that are only used to verify functionality. Limitations \u00b6 Single service instance per machine. High availability and reliability not supported. Resource requirements \u00b6 For information about the resource requirements for standalone NebulaGraph, see Software requirements for compiling NebulaGraph . Steps \u00b6 Currently, you can only install standalone NebulaGraph with the source code. The steps are similar to those of the multi-process NebulaGraph. You only need to modify the step Generate Makefile with CMake by adding -DENABLE_STANDALONE_VERSION=on to the command. For example: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr/local/nebula -DENABLE_TESTING = OFF -DENABLE_STANDALONE_VERSION = on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release .. For more information about installation details, see Install NebulaGraph by compiling the source code . After installing standalone NebulaGraph, see the topic connect to Service to connect to NebulaGraph databases. Configuration file \u00b6 The path to the configuration file for standalone NebulaGraph is /usr/local/nebula/etc by default. You can run sudo cat nebula-standalone.conf.default to see the file content. The parameters and the corresponding descriptions in the file are generally the same as the configurations for multi-process NebulaGraph except for the following parameters. Parameter Predefined value Description meta_port 9559 The port number of the Meta service. storage_port 9779 The port number of the Storage Service. meta_data_path data/meta The path to Meta data.

Prerequisites \u00b6 Users have to prepare correct resources described in Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running NebulaGraph . Note Compilation of NebulaGraph offline is not currently supported. The host to be installed with NebulaGraph has access to the Internet. For NebulaGraph Enterprise, you must have the license key loaded in LM . Installation steps \u00b6 Use Git to clone the source code of NebulaGraph to the host. [Recommended] To install NebulaGraph 3.5.0, run the following command. $ git clone --branch release-3.5-snapchat https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git To install the latest developing release, run the following command to clone the source code from the master branch. $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git Go to the nebula/third-party directory, and run the install-third-party.sh script to install the third-party libraries. $ cd nebula/third-party $ ./install-third-party.sh Go back to the nebula directory, create a directory named build , and enter the directory. $ cd .. $ mkdir build && cd build Generate Makefile with CMake. Note The installation path is /usr/local/nebula by default. To customize it, add the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path> CMake variable in the following command. For more information about CMake variables, see CMake variables . $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr/local/nebula -DENABLE_TESTING = OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release .. Compile NebulaGraph. Note Check Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running NebulaGraph . To speed up the compiling, use the -j option to set a concurrent number N . It should be \\(\\min(\\text{CPU}core number,\\frac{the_memory_size(GB)}{2})\\) . $ make -j { N } # E.g., make -j2 Install NebulaGraph. $ sudo make install (Enterprise only) For Enterprise Edition, set the value of license_manager_url to the host IP and port number 9119 where the license management tool is located in the Meta service configuration file of NebulaGraph ( nebula-metad.conf ), e.g. 192.168.8.100:9119 . Note The configuration files in the etc/ directory ( /usr/local/nebula/etc by default) are references. Users can create their own configuration files accordingly. If you want to use the scripts in the script directory to start, stop, restart, and kill the service, and check the service status, the configuration files have to be named as nebula-graph.conf , nebula-metad.conf , and nebula-storaged.conf . Update the master branch \u00b6 The source code of the master branch changes frequently. If the corresponding NebulaGraph release is installed, update it in the following steps. In the nebula directory, run git pull upstream master to update the source code. In the nebula/build directory, run make -j{N} and make install again. Next to do \u00b6 Manage NebulaGraph services CMake variables \u00b6 Usage of CMake variables \u00b6 $ cmake -D<variable> = <value> ... The following CMake variables can be used at the configure (cmake) stage to adjust the compiling settings. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX \u00b6 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX specifies the path where the service modules, scripts, configuration files are installed. The default path is /usr/local/nebula . ENABLE_WERROR \u00b6 ENABLE_WERROR is ON by default and it makes all warnings into errors. You can set it to OFF if needed. ENABLE_TESTING \u00b6 ENABLE_TESTING is ON by default and unit tests are built with the NebulaGraph services. If you just need the service modules, set it to OFF . ENABLE_ASAN \u00b6 ENABLE_ASAN is OFF by default and the building of ASan (AddressSanitizer), a memory error detector, is disabled. To enable it, set ENABLE_ASAN to ON . This variable is intended for NebulaGraph developers. CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE \u00b6 NebulaGraph supports the following building types of MAKE_BUILD_TYPE : Debug The default value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE . It indicates building NebulaGraph with the debug info but not the optimization options. Release It indicates building NebulaGraph with the optimization options but not the debug info. RelWithDebInfo It indicates building NebulaGraph with the optimization options and the debug info. MinSizeRel It indicates building NebulaGraph with the optimization options for controlling the code size but not the debug info. ENABLE_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE \u00b6 ENABLE_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE is OFF by default. When set to ON and include-what-you-use is installed on the system, the system reports redundant headers contained in the project source code during makefile generation. NEBULA_USE_LINKER \u00b6 Specifies the program linker on the system. The available values are: bfd , the default value, indicates that ld.bfd is applied as the linker. lld , indicates that ld.lld, if installed on the system, is applied as the linker. gold , indicates that ld.gold, if installed on the system, is applied as the linker. CMAKE_C_COMPILER/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER \u00b6 Usually, CMake locates and uses a C/C++ compiler installed in the host automatically. But if your compiler is not installed at the standard path, or if you want to use a different one, run the command as follows to specify the installation path of the target compiler: $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER = <path_to_gcc/bin/gcc> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = <path_to_gcc/bin/g++> .. $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER = <path_to_clang/bin/clang> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = <path_to_clang/bin/clang++> .. ENABLE_CCACHE \u00b6 ENABLE_CCACHE is ON by default and Ccache (compiler cache) is used to speed up the compiling of NebulaGraph. To disable ccache , setting ENABLE_CCACHE to OFF is not enough. On some platforms, the ccache installation hooks up or precedes the compiler. In such a case, you have to set an environment variable export CCACHE_DISABLE=true or add a line disable=true in ~/.ccache/ccache.conf as well. For more information, see the ccache official documentation . NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT \u00b6 NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT specifies the path where the third party software is installed. By default it is /opt/vesoft/third-party . Examine problems \u00b6 If the compiling fails, we suggest you: Check whether the operating system release meets the requirements and whether the memory and hard disk space are sufficient. Check whether the third-party is installed correctly. Use make -j1 to reduce the compiling concurrency.","title":"Compile the source"},{"location":"4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/1.install-nebula-graph-by-compiling-the-source-code/#install_nebulagraph_by_compiling_the_source_code","text":"Installing NebulaGraph from the source code allows you to customize the compiling and installation settings and test the latest features.","title":"Install NebulaGraph by compiling the source code"},{"location":"4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/1.install-nebula-graph-by-compiling-the-source-code/#prerequisites","text":"Users have to prepare correct resources described in Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running NebulaGraph .

Modify configurations \u00b6 The configuration file of NebulaGraph deployed by Docker Compose is nebula-docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml . To make the new configuration take effect, modify the configuration in this file and restart the service. For more instructions, see Configurations . FAQ \u00b6 How to fix the docker mapping to external ports? \u00b6 To set the ports of corresponding services as fixed mapping, modify the docker-compose.yaml in the nebula-docker-compose directory. For example: graphd: image: vesoft/nebula-graphd:release-3.5-snapchat ... ports: - 9669 :9669 - 19669 - 19670 9669:9669 indicates the internal port 9669 is uniformly mapped to external ports, while 19669 indicates the internal port 19669 is randomly mapped to external ports. How to upgrade or update the docker images of NebulaGraph services \u00b6 In the nebula-docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml file, change all the image values to the required image version. In the nebula-docker-compose directory, run docker-compose pull to update the images of the Graph Service, Storage Service, Meta Service, and NebulaGraph Console. Run docker-compose up -d to start the NebulaGraph services again. After connecting to NebulaGraph with NebulaGraph Console, run SHOW HOSTS GRAPH , SHOW HOSTS STORAGE , or SHOW HOSTS META to check the version of the responding service respectively. ERROR: toomanyrequests when docker-compose pull \u00b6 You may meet the following error. ERROR: toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit.

Compiling NebulaGraph requires certain dependencies which might conflict with host system dependencies, potentially causing compilation failures. Docker offers a solution to this. NebulaGraph provides a Docker image containing the complete compilation environment, ensuring an efficient build process and avoiding host OS conflicts. This guide outlines the steps to compile NebulaGraph using Docker. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before you begin: Docker : Ensure Docker is installed on your system. Clone NebulaGraph's Source Code : Clone the repository locally using: git clone --branch release-3.5-snapchat https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git This clones the NebulaGraph source code to a subdirectory named nebula . Compilation steps \u00b6 Pull the NebulaGraph compilation image. docker pull vesoft/nebula-dev:ubuntu2004 Here, we use the official NebulaGraph compilation image, ubuntu2004 . For different versions, see nebula-dev-docker . Start the compilation container. docker run -ti \\ --security-opt seccomp = unconfined \\ -v \" $PWD \" :/home \\ -w /home \\ --name nebula_dev \\ vesoft/nebula-dev:ubuntu2004 \\ bash --security-opt seccomp=unconfined : Disables the seccomp security mechanism to avoid compilation errors. -v \"$PWD\":/home : Mounts the local path of the NebulaGraph code to the container's /home directory. -w /home : Sets the container's working directory to /home . Any command run inside the container will use this directory as the current directory. --name nebula_dev : Assigns a name to the container, making it easier to manage and operate. vesoft/nebula-dev:ubuntu2004 : Uses the ubuntu2004 version of the vesoft/nebula-dev compilation image. bash : Executes the bash command inside the container, entering the container's interactive terminal. After executing this command, you'll enter an interactive terminal inside the container. To re-enter the container, use docker exec -ti nebula_dev bash . Compile NebulaGraph inside the container. Enter the NebulaGraph source code directory. cd nebula Create a build directory and enter it. mkdir build && cd build Use CMake to generate the Makefile. cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = $TOOLSET_CLANG_DIR /bin/g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER = $TOOLSET_CLANG_DIR /bin/gcc -DENABLE_WERROR = OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug -DENABLE_TESTING = OFF .. For more on CMake, see CMake Parameters . Compile NebulaGraph. # The -j parameter specifies the number of threads to use. # If you have a multi-core CPU, you can use more threads to speed up compilation. make -j2 Compilation might take some time based on your system performance. Install the Executables and Libraries. Post successful compilation, NebulaGraph's binaries and libraries are located in /home/nebula/build . Install them to /usr/local/nebula : make install Once completed, NebulaGraph is compiled and installed in the host directory /usr/local/nebula .

Applicable source versions \u00b6 This topic applies to upgrading NebulaGraph from 2.5.0 and later 2.x, and 3.x versions to 3.5.0. It does not apply to historical versions earlier than 2.5.0, including the 1.x versions. To upgrade NebulaGraph from historical versions to 3.5.0: Upgrade it to the latest 2.5 version according to the docs of that version. Follow this topic to upgrade it to 3.5.0. Caution To upgrade NebulaGraph from versions earlier than 2.0.0 (including the 1.x versions) to 3.5.0, you need to find the date_time_zonespec.csv in the share/resources directory of 3.5.0 files, and then copy it to the same directory in the NebulaGraph installation path. Limitations \u00b6 Rolling Upgrade is not supported. You must stop all the NebulaGraph services before the upgrade. There is no upgrade script. You have to manually upgrade each server in the cluster. This topic does not apply to scenarios where NebulaGraph is deployed with Docker, including Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, and K8s. You must upgrade the old NebulaGraph services on the same machines they are deployed. DO NOT change the IP addresses, configuration files of the machines, and DO NOT change the cluster topology. Known issues that could cause data loss are listed on GitHub known issues . The issues are all related to altering schema or default values. DO NOT use soft links to switch the data directories. You must have the sudo privileges to complete the steps in this topic. Upgrade influences \u00b6 Client compatibility After the upgrade, you will not be able to connect to NebulaGraph from old clients. You will need to upgrade all clients to a version compatible with NebulaGraph 3.5.0. Configuration changes A few configuration parameters have been changed. For more information, see the release notes and configuration docs. nGQL compatibility The nGQL syntax is partially incompatible: Disable the YIELD clause to return custom variables. The YIELD clause is required in the FETCH , GO , LOOKUP , FIND PATH and GET SUBGRAPH statements. It is required to specify a tag to query properties of a vertex in a MATCH statement. For example, from return v.name to return v.player.name . Full-text indexes Before upgrading a NebulaGraph cluster with full-text indexes deployed, you must manually delete the full-text indexes in Elasticsearch, and then run the SIGN IN command to log into ES and recreate the indexes after the upgrade is complete. To manually delete the full-text indexes in Elasticsearch, you can use the curl command curl -XDELETE -u <es_username>:<es_password> '<es_access_ip>:<port>/<fullindex_name>' , for example, curl -XDELETE -u elastic:elastic 'http://192.168.8.xxx:9200/nebula_index_2534' . If no username and password are set for Elasticsearch, you can omit the -u <es_username>:<es_password> part. Caution There may be other undiscovered influences. Before the upgrade, we recommend that you read the release notes and user manual carefully, and keep an eye on the posts on the forum and issues on Github. Preparations before the upgrade \u00b6 Download the package of NebulaGraph 3.5.0 according to your operating system and system architecture. You need the binary files during the upgrade. Find the package on the download page . Note You can also get the new binaries from the source code or the RPM/DEB package. Locate the data files based on the value of the data_path parameters in the Storage and Meta configurations, and backup the data files. The default paths are nebula/data/storage and nebula/data/meta . Danger The old data will not be automatically backed up during the upgrade. You must manually back up the data to avoid data loss. Backup the configuration files. Collect the statistics of all graph spaces before the upgrade. After the upgrade, you can collect again and compare the results to make sure that no data is lost. To collect the statistics: Run SUBMIT JOB STATS . Run SHOW JOBS and record the result. Upgrade steps \u00b6 Stop all NebulaGraph services. <nebula_install_path>/scripts/nebula.service stop all nebula_install_path indicates the installation path of NebulaGraph. The storaged progress needs around 1 minute to flush data. You can run nebula.service status all to check if all services are stopped. For more information about starting and stopping services, see Manage services . Note If the services are not fully stopped in 20 minutes, stop upgrading and ask for help on the forum or Github . Caution Starting from version 3.0.0, it is possible to insert vertices without tags. If you need to keep vertices without tags, add --graph_use_vertex_key=true in the configuration file ( nebula-graphd.conf ) of all Graph services within the cluster; and add --use_vertex_key=true in the configuration file ( nebula-storaged.conf ) of all Storage services.\" In the target path where you unpacked the package, use the binaries in the bin directory to replace the old binaries in the bin directory in the NebulaGraph installation path. Note Update the binary of the corresponding service on each NebulaGraph server. Modify the following parameters in all Graph configuration files to accommodate the value range of the new version. If the parameter values are within the specified range, skip this step. Set a value in [1,604800] for session_idle_timeout_secs . The recommended value is 28800. Set a value in [1,604800] for client_idle_timeout_secs . The recommended value is 28800. The default values of these parameters in the 2.x versions are not within the range of the new version. If you do not change the default values, the upgrade will fail. For detailed parameter description, see Graph Service Configuration . Start all Meta services. <nebula_install_path>/scripts/nebula-metad.service start Once started, the Meta services take several seconds to elect a leader. To verify that Meta services are all started, you can start any Graph server, connect to it through NebulaGraph Console, and run SHOW HOSTS meta and SHOW META LEADER . If the status of Meta services are correctly returned, the services are successfully started. Note If the operation fails, stop the upgrade and ask for help on the forum or GitHub . Start all the Graph and Storage services. Note If the operation fails, stop the upgrade and ask for help on the forum or GitHub . Connect to the new version of NebulaGraph to verify that services are available and data are complete. For how to connect, see Connect to NebulaGraph . Currently, there is no official way to check whether the upgrade is successful. You can run the following reference statements to test the upgrade: nebula> SHOW HOSTS; nebula> SHOW HOSTS storage; nebula> SHOW SPACES; nebula> USE <space_name> nebula> SHOW PARTS; nebula> SUBMIT JOB STATS; nebula> SHOW STATS; nebula> MATCH (v) RETURN v LIMIT 5; You can also test against new features in version 3.5.0. Upgrade failure and rollback \u00b6 If the upgrade fails, stop all NebulaGraph services of the new version, recover the old configuration files and binaries, and start the services of the old version. All NebulaGraph clients in use must be switched to the old version. FAQ \u00b6 Can I write through the client during the upgrade? \u00b6 A: No. You must stop all NebulaGraph services during the upgrade. The Space 0 not found warning message during the upgrade process \u00b6 When the Space 0 not found warning message appears during the upgrade process, you can ignore it. The space 0 is used to store meta information about the Storage service and does not contain user data, so it will not affect the upgrade. How to upgrade if a machine has only the Graph Service, but not the Storage Service? \u00b6 A: You only need to update the configuration files and binaries of the Graph Service. How to resolve the error Permission denied ? \u00b6 A: Try again with the sudo privileges. Is there any change in gflags? \u00b6 A: Yes. For more information, see the release notes and configuration docs. Is there a tool or solution for verifying data consistency after the upgrade? \u00b6 A: No. But if you only want to check the number of vertices and edges, run SUBMIT JOB STATS and SHOW STATS after the upgrade, and compare the result with the result that you recorded before the upgrade. How to solve the issue that Storage is OFFLINE and Leader count is 0 ? \u00b6 A: Run the following statement to add the Storage hosts into the cluster manually. ADD HOSTS <ip>:<port>[, <ip>:<port> ...]; For example: ADD HOSTS 192.168.10.100:9779, 192.168.10.101:9779, 192.168.10.102:9779; If the issue persists, ask for help on the forum or GitHub . Why the job type changed after the upgrade, but job ID remains the same? \u00b6 A: SHOW JOBS depends on an internal ID to identify job types, but in NebulaGraph 2.5.0 the internal ID changed in this pull request , so this issue happens after upgrading from a version earlier than 2.5.0.","title":"Upgrade NebulaGraph Community to the latest version"},{"location":"4.deployment-and-installation/3.upgrade-nebula-graph/upgrade-nebula-graph-to-latest/#upgrade_nebulagraph_to_350","text":"This topic describes how to upgrade NebulaGraph from version 2.x and 3.x to 3.5.0, taking upgrading from version 2.6.1 to 3.5.0 as an example.","title":"Upgrade NebulaGraph to 3.5.0"},{"location":"4.deployment-and-installation/3.upgrade-nebula-graph/upgrade-nebula-graph-to-latest/#applicable_source_versions","text":"This topic applies to upgrading NebulaGraph from 2.5.0 and later 2.x, and 3.x versions to 3.5.0.

You must stop all the NebulaGraph services before the upgrade. There is no upgrade script. You have to manually upgrade each server in the cluster. This topic does not apply to scenarios where NebulaGraph is deployed with Docker, including Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, and K8s. You must upgrade the old NebulaGraph services on the same machines they are deployed. DO NOT change the IP addresses, configuration files of the machines, and DO NOT change the cluster topology. Known issues that could cause data loss are listed on GitHub known issues . The issues are all related to altering schema or default values. DO NOT use soft links to switch the data directories.

You will need to upgrade all clients to a version compatible with NebulaGraph 3.5.0. Configuration changes A few configuration parameters have been changed. For more information, see the release notes and configuration docs. nGQL compatibility The nGQL syntax is partially incompatible: Disable the YIELD clause to return custom variables. The YIELD clause is required in the FETCH , GO , LOOKUP , FIND PATH and GET SUBGRAPH statements. It is required to specify a tag to query properties of a vertex in a MATCH statement. For example, from return v.name to return v.player.name . Full-text indexes Before upgrading a NebulaGraph cluster with full-text indexes deployed, you must manually delete the full-text indexes in Elasticsearch, and then run the SIGN IN command to log into ES and recreate the indexes after the upgrade is complete. To manually delete the full-text indexes in Elasticsearch, you can use the curl command curl -XDELETE -u <es_username>:<es_password> '<es_access_ip>:<port>/<fullindex_name>' , for example, curl -XDELETE -u elastic:elastic 'http://192.168.8.xxx:9200/nebula_index_2534' . If no username and password are set for Elasticsearch, you can omit the -u <es_username>:<es_password> part. Caution There may be other undiscovered influences.

The Raft Listener (Listener for short) is a separate process that fetches data from the Storage Service and writes them into the Elasticsearch cluster. Prerequisites \u00b6 You have read and fully understood the restrictions for using full-text indexes. You have deployed a NebulaGraph cluster . You have deploy a Elasticsearch cluster . You have prepared at least one extra Storage Server. To use the full-text search, you must run one or more Storage Server as the Raft Listener. Precautions \u00b6 The Storage Service that you want to run as the Listener must have the same or later release with all the other Nebula Graph services in the cluster. For now, you can only add all Listeners to a graph space once and for all. Trying to add a new Listener to a graph space that already has a Listener will fail. To add all Listeners, set them in one statement . Deployment process \u00b6 Step 1: Install the Storage service \u00b6 The Listener process and the storaged process use the same binary file. However, their configuration files and using ports are different. You can install NebulaGraph on all servers that need to deploy a Listener, but only the Storage service can be used. For details, see Install NebulaGraph by RPM or DEB Package . Step 2: Prepare the configuration file for the Listener \u00b6 You have to prepare a corresponding configuration file on the machine that you want to deploy a Listener. The file must be named as nebula-storaged-listener.conf and stored in the etc directory. A template is provided for your reference. Note that the file suffix .production should be removed. Most configurations are the same as the configurations of Storage Service . This topic only introduces the differences. Name Default value Description daemonize true When set to true , the process is a daemon process. pid_file pids/nebula-metad-listener.pid The file that records the process ID. meta_server_addrs - IP addresses and ports of all Meta services. Multiple Meta services are separated by commas. local_ip - The local IP address of the Listener service. port - The listening port of the RPC daemon of the Listener service. heartbeat_interval_secs 10 The heartbeat interval of the Meta service. The unit is second (s). listener_path data/listener The WAL directory of the Listener. Only one directory is allowed. data_path data For compatibility reasons, this parameter can be ignored.

You have prepared one or multiple servers to run one or multiple raft listeners. Precautions \u00b6 The Storage Service that you want to run as the Listener must have the same or later release with all the other Nebula Graph services in the cluster.

To add all Listeners, set them in one statement . Deployment process \u00b6 Step 1: Install the Listener service \u00b6 The Listener service uses the same binary as the storaged service. However, the configuration files are different and the processes use different ports. You can install NebulaGraph on all servers that need to deploy a Listener, but only the storaged service can be used. For details, see Install NebulaGraph by RPM or DEB Package . Step 2: Prepare the configuration file for the Listener \u00b6 In the etc directory, remove the suffix from nebula-storaged-listener.conf.default or nebula-storaged-listener.conf.production to nebula-storaged-listener.conf , and then modify the configuration content.

Most configurations are flags. When the NebulaGraph service starts, it will get the configuration information from Configuration files by default. Configurations that are not in the file apply the default values. Enterpriseonly The tuning service for performance, parameters and query statements are provided only in the Enterprise Edition. Note Because there are many configurations and they may change as NebulaGraph develops, this topic will not introduce all configurations. To get detailed descriptions of configurations, follow the instructions below. It is not recommended to modify the configurations that are not introduced in this topic, unless you are familiar with the source code and fully understand the function of configurations. Legacy version compatibility In the topic of 1.x, we provide a method of using the CONFIGS command to modify the configurations in the cache. However, using this method in a production environment can easily cause inconsistencies of configurations between clusters and the local. Therefore, this method will no longer be introduced starting with version 2.x. Get the configuration list and descriptions \u00b6 Use the following command to get all the configuration information of the service corresponding to the binary file: <binary> --help For example: # Get the help information from Meta $ /usr/local/nebula/bin/nebula-metad --help # Get the help information from Graph $ /usr/local/nebula/bin/nebula-graphd --help # Get the help information from Storage $ /usr/local/nebula/bin/nebula-storaged --help The above examples use the default storage path /usr/local/nebula/bin/ . If you modify the installation path of NebulaGraph, use the actual path to query the configurations. Get configurations \u00b6 Use the curl command to get the value of the running configurations. For example: # Get the running configurations from Meta curl 127 .0.0.1:19559/flags # Get the running configurations from Graph curl 127 .0.0.1:19669/flags # Get the running configurations from Storage curl 127 .0.0.1:19779/flags Note In an actual environment, use the real host IP address instead of 127.0.0.1 in the above example. Configuration files \u00b6 Configuration files for clusters installed from source, with an RPM/DEB package, or a TAR package \u00b6 NebulaGraph provides two initial configuration files for each service, <service_name>.conf.default and <service_name>.conf.production . You can use them in different scenarios conveniently. For clusters installed from source and with a RPM/DEB package, the default path is /usr/local/nebula/etc/ . For clusters installed with a TAR package, the path is <install_path>/<tar_package_directory>/etc . The configuration values in the initial configuration file are for reference only and can be adjusted according to actual needs. To use the initial configuration file, choose one of the above two files and delete the suffix .default or .production to make it valid. Caution To ensure the availability of services, the configurations of the same service must be consistent, except for the local IP address local_ip . For example, three Storage servers are deployed in one NebulaGraph cluster. The configurations of the three Storage servers need to be the same, except for the IP address. The initial configuration files corresponding to each service are as follows. NebulaGraph service Initial configuration file Description Meta nebula-metad.conf.default and nebula-metad.conf.production Meta service configuration Graph nebula-graphd.conf.default and nebula-graphd.conf.production Graph service configuration Storage nebula-storaged.conf.default and nebula-storaged.conf.production Storage service configuration Each initial configuration file of all services contains local_config . The default value is true , which means that the NebulaGraph service will get configurations from its configuration files and start it. Caution It is not recommended to modify the value of local_config to false . If modified, the NebulaGraph service will first read the cached configurations, which may cause configuration inconsistencies between clusters and cause unknown risks. Configuration files for clusters installed with Docker Compose \u00b6 For clusters installed with Docker Compose, the configuration file's default installation path of the cluster is <install_path>/nebula-docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml . The parameters in the command field of the file are the launch parameters for each service. Configuration files for clusters installed with NebulaGraph Operator \u00b6 For clusters installed with Kubectl through NebulaGraph Operator, the configuration file's path is the path of the cluster YAML file. You can modify the configuration of each service through the spec.{graphd|storaged|metad}.config parameter. Note The services cannot be configured for clusters installed with Helm. Modify configurations \u00b6 You can modify the configurations of NebulaGraph in the configuration file or use commands to dynamically modify configurations. Caution Using both methods to modify the configuration can cause the configuration information to be managed inconsistently, which may result in confusion. It is recommended to only use the configuration file to manage the configuration, or to make the same modifications to the configuration file after dynamically updating the configuration through commands to ensure consistency. Modifying configurations in the configuration file \u00b6 By default, each NebulaGraph service gets configured from its configuration files. You can modify configurations and make them valid according to the following steps: For clusters installed from source, with a RPM/DEB, or a TAR package Use a text editor to modify the configuration files of the target service and save the modification. Choose an appropriate time to restart all NebulaGraph services to make the modifications valid. For clusters installed with Docker Compose In the <install_path>/nebula-docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml file, modify the configurations of the target service. In the nebula-docker-compose directory, run the command docker-compose up -d to restart the service involving configuration modifications. For clusters installed with Kubectl For details, see Customize configuration parameters for a NebulaGraph cluster . Dynamically modifying configurations using command \u00b6 You can dynamically modify the configuration of NebulaGraph by using the curl command. For example, to modify the wal_ttl parameter of the Storage service to 600 , use the following command: curl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"wal_ttl\":\"600\"}' -s \"http://192.168.15.6:19779/flags\" In this command, {\"wal_ttl\":\"600\"} specifies the configuration parameter and its value to be modified, and 192.168.15.6:19779 specifies the IP address and HTTP port number of the Storage service. Caution The functionality of dynamically modifying configurations is only applicable to prototype verification and testing environments. It is not recommended to use this feature in production environments. This is because when the local_config value is set to true , the dynamically modified configuration is not persisted, and the configuration will be restored to the initial configuration after the service is restarted. Only part of the configuration parameters can be dynamically modified. For the specific list of parameters that can be modified, see the description of Whether supports runtime dynamic modifications in the respective service configuration.","title":"Configurations"},{"location":"5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations/#configurations","text":"NebulaGraph builds the configurations based on the gflags repository.

Resource control \u00b6 ulimit precautions \u00b6 The ulimit command specifies the resource threshold for the current shell session. The precautions are as follows: The changes made by ulimit only take effect for the current session or child process. The resource threshold (soft threshold) cannot exceed the hard threshold. Common users cannot use commands to adjust the hard threshold, even with sudo . To modify the system level or adjust the hard threshold, edit the file /etc/security/limits.conf . This method requires re-login to take effect. ulimit -c \u00b6 ulimit -c limits the size of the core dumps. We recommend that you set it to unlimited . The command is: ulimit -c unlimited ulimit -n \u00b6 ulimit -n limits the number of open files. We recommend that you set it to more than 100,000. For example: ulimit -n 130000 Memory \u00b6 vm.swappiness \u00b6 vm.swappiness specifies the percentage of the available memory before starting swap. The greater the value, the more likely the swap occurs. We recommend that you set it to 0. When set to 0, the page cache is removed first. Note that when vm.swappiness is 0, it does not mean that there is no swap. vm.min_free_kbytes \u00b6 vm.min_free_kbytes specifies the minimum number of kilobytes available kept by Linux VM. If you have a large system memory, we recommend that you increase this value. For example, if your physical memory 128GB, set it to 5GB. If the value is not big enough, the system cannot apply for enough continuous physical memory. vm.max_map_count \u00b6 vm.max_map_count limits the maximum number of vma (virtual memory area) for a process. The default value is 65530 . It is enough for most applications. If your memory application fails because the memory consumption is large, increase the vm.max_map_count value. vm.dirty_* \u00b6 These values control the dirty data cache for the system. For write-intensive scenarios, you can make adjustments based on your needs (throughput priority or delay priority). We recommend that you use the system default value. Transparent huge page \u00b6 For better delay performance, you must run the following commands to disable the transparent huge pages (THP). root# echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled root# echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag root# swapoff -a && swapon -a To prevent THP from being enabled again after the system restarts, you can modify the GRUB configuration file or /etc/rc.local to disable THP automatically upon system startup. Networking \u00b6 net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle \u00b6 The default value of net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle is 1 . If set, the congestion window is timed out after an idle period. We recommend that you set it to 0 , especially for long fat scenarios (high latency and large bandwidth). net.core.somaxconn \u00b6 net.core.somaxconn specifies the maximum number of connection queues listened by the socket. The default value is 128 . For scenarios with a large number of burst connections, we recommend that you set it to greater than 1024 . net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog \u00b6 net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog specifies the maximum number of TCP connections in the SYN_RECV (semi-connected) state. The setting rule for this parameter is the same as that of net.core.somaxconn . net.core.netdev_max_backlog \u00b6 net.core.netdev_max_backlog specifies the maximum number of packets. The default value is 1000 . We recommend that you increase it to greater than 10,000 , especially for 10G network adapters. net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_* \u00b6 These values keep parameters alive for TCP connections. For applications that use a 4-layer transparent load balancer, if the idle connection is disconnected unexpectedly, decrease the values of tcp_keepalive_time and tcp_keepalive_intvl . net.ipv4.tcp_rmem/wmem \u00b6 net.ipv4.tcp_wmem/rmem specifies the minimum, default, and maximum size of the buffer pool sent/received by the TCP socket. For long fat links, we recommend that you increase the default value to bandwidth (GB) * RTT (ms) . scheduler \u00b6 For SSD devices, we recommend that you set scheduler to noop or none . The path is /sys/block/DEV_NAME/queue/scheduler . Other parameters \u00b6 kernel.core_pattern \u00b6 we recommend that you set it to core and set kernel.core_uses_pid to 1 .

Metrics structure \u00b6 Each metric of NebulaGraph consists of three fields: name, type, and time range. The fields are separated by periods, for example, num_queries.sum.600 . Different NebulaGraph services (Graph, Storage, or Meta) support different metrics. The detailed description is as follows. Field Example Description Metric name num_queries Indicates the function of the metric. Metric type sum Indicates how the metrics are collected. Supported types are SUM, AVG, RATE, and the P-th sample quantiles such as P75, P95, P99, and P99.9. Time range 600 The time range in seconds for the metric collection. Supported values are 5, 60, 600, and 3600, representing the last 5 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes, and 1 hour.

Space-level metrics \u00b6 The Graph service supports a set of space-level metrics that record the information of different graph spaces separately. Space-level metrics can be queried only by querying all metrics. For example, run curl -G \"http://192.168.8.40:19559/stats\" to show all metrics. The returned result contains the graph space name in the form of '{space=space_name}', such as num_active_queries{space=basketballplayer}.sum.5=0 .

SSL and TLS are both security protocols used for network communication, with SSL being the predecessor to TLS. While mTLS is an enhanced version of TLS/SSL that employs mutual authentication to provide an even more secure communication method. This topic describes how to set up TLS and mTLS for SSL. Precaution \u00b6 Enabling SSL encryption will slightly affect the performance, such as causing operation latency. Certificate modes \u00b6 To use SSL encryption, SSL certificates are required. NebulaGraph supports two certificate modes. Self-signed certificate mode A certificate that is generated by the server itself and signed by itself. In the self-signed certificate mode, the server needs to generate its own SSL certificate and key, and then use its own private key to sign the certificate. It is suitable for building secure communications for systems and applications within a LAN. CA-signed certificate mode A certificate granted by a trusted third-party Certificate Authority (CA). In the CA signed certificate mode, the server needs to apply for an SSL certificate from a trusted CA and ensure the authenticity and trustworthiness of the certificate through the auditing and signing of the certificate authority center. It is suitable for public network environment, especially for websites, e-commerce and other occasions that need to protect user information security. Authentication policies \u00b6 - External device access to Graph Graph access Meta/Storage External device access to Graph Graph access Meta/Storage TLS Modify the Graph configuration file to add the following parameters: --enable_graph_ssl = true --ca_path=xxxxxx --cert_path=xxxxxx --key_path=xxxxxx In the Graph/Meta/Storage configuration file, add the following parameters: --enable_meta_ssl = true --ca_path=xxxxxx --cert_path=xxxxxx --key_path=xxxxxx In the Graph/Meta/Storage configuration file, add the following parameters: --enable_ssl = true --ca_path=xxxxxx --cert_path=xxxxxx --key_path=xxxxxx mTLS Modify the Graph configuration file to add the following parameters: --enable_graph_ssl = true --ca_path=xxxxxx --cert_path=xxxxxx --key_path=xxxxxx --ca_client_path=xxxxxx In the Graph/Meta/Storage configuration file, add the following parameters: --enable_meta_ssl = true --ca_path=xxxxxx --cert_path=xxxxxx --key_path=xxxxxx --ca_client_path=xxxxxx In the Graph/Meta/Storage configuration file, add the following parameters: --enable_ssl = true --ca_path=xxxxxx --cert_path=xxxxxx --key_path=xxxxxx --ca_client_path=xxxxxx Note When mTLS is required for external clients to connect to the Graph service, the user needs to set the relevant SSL parameters (especially ca_path ) depending on the client . See below for examples of authentication. The parameters are described below. Parameter Default value Description cert_path - The path to the SSL public key certificate. This certificate is usually a .pem or .crt file, which is used to prove the identity of the server side, and contains information such as the public key, certificate owner, digital signature, and so on. key_path - The path to the SSL key. The SSL key is usually a .key file. password_path - (Optional) The path to the password file for the SSL key. Some SSL keys are encrypted and require a corresponding password to decrypt. We need to store the password in a separate file and use this parameter to specify the path to the password file. ca_path - The path to the SSL root certificate. The root certificate is a special SSL certificate that is considered the highest level in the SSL trust chain and is used to validate and authorize other SSL certificates. ca_client_path - The path to the client SSL root certificate. It is mTLS when this parameter is used. For mTLS, the server needs to store the root certificate that generates the client SSL certificate, which is used to validate the client public key certificate. enable_ssl false Whether to enable SSL encryption in all services. only. enable_graph_ssl false Whether to enable SSL encryption in the Graph service only. enable_meta_ssl false Whether to enable SSL encryption in the Meta service only. Example of TLS \u00b6 For example, using self-signed certificates and TLS for data transfers between the client NebulaGraph Python, the Graph service, the Meta service, and the Storage service. You need to set up all three Graph/Meta/Storage configuration files as follows: --enable_ssl = true --ca_path = xxxxxx --cert_path = xxxxxx --key_path = xxxxxx When the changes are complete, restart these services to make the configuration take effect. To connect to the Graph service using NebulaGraph Python, you need to set up a secure socket and add a trusted CA. For code examples, see nebula-test-run.py . Example of mTLS \u00b6 For example, using CA-signed certificates and mTLS for data transfers between the client NebulaGraph Console and the Graph service. You need to set up the Graph configuration file as follows: --enable_graph_ssl = true --ca_path = xxxxxx --cert_path = xxxxxx --key_path = xxxxxx --ca_client_path = xxxxxx When the changes are complete, restart the Graph service to make the configuration take effect. Use the NebulaGraph Console to connect to the Graph service with the following command: ./nebula-console -addr 192 .168.8.100 -port 9669 -u root -p nebula -enable_ssl -ssl_root_ca_path /home/xxx/cert/root.crt -ssl_cert_path /home/xxx/cert/client.crt -ssl_private_key_path /home/xxx/cert/client.key Automatic monitoring of SSL certificate updates \u00b6 NebulaGraph supports monitoring SSL certificates for updates, automatically triggering reloading of certificates and re-authentication when an update is detected. NebulaGraph monitors the file specified by the cert_path parameter by default and triggers a re-authentication if the file changes. Note Since changing the files specified by cert_path triggers re-authentication, when updating a certificate, you should update the key_path , ca_path , and other files first, and then update the cert_path files last. If you want to use symbol links, you can add the parameter ssl_watch_path to each configuration file where cert_path is added to specify the parent directory of the symbol link where the SSL file is stored, e.g., if the symbol link path is /home/xxx/share/current , the ssl_watch_path needs to be set to /home/xxx/share .

Note The following suggestions may not apply to some special scenarios. In these cases, find help in the NebulaGraph community . Model for performance \u00b6 There is no perfect method to model in Nebula Graph. Graph modeling depends on the questions that you want to know from the data. Your data drives your graph model. Graph data modeling is intuitive and convenient. Create your data model based on your business model. Test your model and gradually optimize it to fit your business. To get better performance, you can change or re-design your model multiple times. Design and evaluate the most important queries \u00b6 Usually, various types of queries are validated in test scenarios to assess the overall capabilities of the system. However, in most production scenarios, there are not many types of frequently used queries. You can optimize the data model based on key queries selected according to the Pareto (80/20) principle. Full-graph scanning avoidance \u00b6 Graph traversal can be performed after one or more vertices/edges are located through property indexes or VIDs. But for some query patterns, such as subgraph and path query patterns, the source vertex or edge of the traversal cannot be located through property indexes or VIDs. These queries find all the subgraphs that satisfy the query pattern by scanning the whole graph space which will have poor query performance. NebulaGraph does not implement indexing for the graph structures of subgraphs or paths. No predefined bonds between Tags and Edge types \u00b6 Define the bonds between Tags and Edge types in the application, not NebulaGraph. There are no statements that could get the bonds between Tags and Edge types. Tags/Edge types predefine a set of properties \u00b6 While creating Tags or Edge types, you need to define a set of properties. Properties are part of the NebulaGraph Schema. Control changes in the business model and the data model \u00b6 Changes here refer to changes in business models and data models (meta-information), not changes in the data itself. Some graph databases are designed to be Schema-free, so their data modeling, including the modeling of the graph topology and properties, can be very flexible. Properties can be re-modeled to graph topology, and vice versa. Such systems are often specifically optimized for graph topology access. NebulaGraph 3.5.0 is a strong-Schema (row storage) system, which means that the business model should not change frequently. For example, the property Schema should not change. It is similar to avoiding ALTER TABLE in MySQL. On the contrary, vertices and their edges can be added or deleted at low costs. Thus, the easy-to-change part of the business model should be transformed to vertices or edges, rather than properties. For example, in a business model, people have relatively fixed properties such as age, gender, and name. But their contact, place of visit, trade account, and login device are often changing. The former is suitable for modeling as properties and the latter as vertices or edges. Set temporary properties through self-loop edges \u00b6 As a strong Schema system, NebulaGraph does not support List-type properties. And using ALTER TAG costs too much. If you need to add some temporary properties or List-type properties to a vertex, you can first create an edge type with the required properties, and then insert one or more edges that direct to the vertex itself. The figure is as follows. To retrieve temporary properties of vertices, fetch from self-loop edges. For example: //Create the edge type and insert the loop property. nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS temp(tmp int); nebula> INSERT EDGE temp(tmp) VALUES \"player100\"->\"player100\"@1:(1); nebula> INSERT EDGE temp(tmp) VALUES \"player100\"->\"player100\"@2:(2); nebula> INSERT EDGE temp(tmp) VALUES \"player100\"->\"player100\"@3:(3); //After the data is inserted, you can query the loop property by general query statements, for example: nebula> GO FROM \"player100\" OVER temp YIELD properties(edge).tmp; +----------------------+ | properties(EDGE).tmp | +----------------------+ | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | +----------------------+ //If you want the results to be returned in the form of a List, you can use a function, for example: nebula> MATCH (v1:player)-[e:temp]->() return collect(e.tmp); +----------------+ | collect(e.tmp) | +----------------+ | [1, 2, 3] | +----------------+ Operations on loops are not encapsulated with any syntactic sugars and you can use them just like those on normal edges. About dangling edges \u00b6 A dangling edge is an edge that only connects to a single vertex and only one part of the edge connects to the vertex. In NebulaGraph 3.5.0, dangling edges may appear in the following two cases. Insert edges with INSERT EDGE statement before the source vertex or the destination vertex exists. Delete vertices with DELETE VERTEX statement and the WITH EDGE option is not used. At this time, the system does not delete the related outgoing and incoming edges of the vertices. There will be dangling edges by default. Dangling edges may appear in NebulaGraph 3.5.0 as the design allow it to exist. And there is no MERGE statement like openCypher has. The existence of dangling edges depends entirely on the application level. You can use GO and LOOKUP statements to find a dangling edge, but cannot use the MATCH statement to find a dangling edge. Examples: // Insert an edge that connects two vertices which do not exist in the graph. The source vertex 's ID is ' 11 '. The destination vertex' s ID is '13' . nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS e1 ( name string, age int ) ; nebula> INSERT EDGE e1 ( name, age ) VALUES \"11\" -> \"13\" : ( \"n1\" , 1 ) ; // Query using the ` GO ` statement nebula> GO FROM \"11\" over e1 YIELD properties ( edge ) ; +----------------------+ | properties ( EDGE ) | +----------------------+ | { age: 1 , name: \"n1\" } | +----------------------+ // Query using the ` LOOKUP ` statement nebula> LOOKUP ON e1 YIELD EDGE AS r ; +-------------------------------------------------------+ | r | +-------------------------------------------------------+ | [ :e2 \"11\" -> \"13\" @0 { age: 1 , name: \"n1\" }] | +-------------------------------------------------------+ // Query using the ` MATCH ` statement nebula> MATCH () - [ e:e1 ] -> () RETURN e ; +---+ | e | +---+ +---+ Empty set ( time spent 3153 /3573 us ) Breadth-first traversal over depth-first traversal \u00b6 NebulaGraph has lower performance for depth-first traversal based on the Graph topology, and better performance for breadth-first traversal and obtaining properties. For example, if model A contains properties \"name\", \"age\", and \"eye color\", it is recommended to create a tag person and add properties name , age , and eye_color to it. If you create a tag eye_color and an edge type has , and then create an edge to represent the eye color owned by the person, the traversal performance will not be high. The performance of finding an edge by an edge property is close to that of finding a vertex by a vertex property. For some databases, it is recommended to re-model edge properties as those of the intermediate vertices. For example, model the pattern (src)-[edge {P1, P2}]->(dst) as (src)-[edge1]->(i_node {P1, P2})-[edge2]->(dst) . With NebulaGraph 3.5.0, you can use (src)-[edge {P1, P2}]->(dst) directly to decrease the depth of the traversal and increase the performance. Edge directions \u00b6 To query in the opposite direction of an edge, use the following syntax: (dst)<-[edge]-(src) or GO FROM dst REVERSELY . If you do not care about the directions or want to query against both directions, use the following syntax: (src)-[edge]-(dst) or GO FROM src BIDIRECT . Therefore, there is no need to insert the same edge redundantly in the reversed direction. Set tag properties appropriately \u00b6 Put a group of properties that are on the same level into the same tag. Different groups represent different concepts. Use indexes correctly \u00b6 Using property indexes helps find VIDs through properties, but can lead to great performance reduction . Only use an index when you need to find vertices or edges through their properties. Design VIDs appropriately \u00b6 See VID . Long texts \u00b6 Do not use long texts to create edge properties. Edge properties are stored twice and long texts lead to greater write amplification. For how edges properties are stored, see Storage architecture . It is recommended to store long texts in HBase or Elasticsearch and store its address in NebulaGraph. Dynamic graphs (sequence graphs) are not supported \u00b6 In some scenarios, graphs need to have the time information to describe how the structure of the entire graph changes over time. 1 The Rank field on Edges in NebulaGraph 3.5.0 can be used to store time in int64, but no field on vertices can do this because if you store the time information as property values, it will be covered by new insertion. Thus NebulaGraph does not support sequence graphs.

In NebulaGraph, Compaction is the most important background process and has an important effect on performance. Compaction reads the data that is written on the hard disk, then re-organizes the data structure and the indexes, and then writes back to the hard disk. The read performance can increase by times after compaction. Thus, to get high read performance, trigger compaction (full compaction ) manually when writing a large amount of data into Nebula Graph. Note Note that compaction leads to long-time hard disk IO. We suggest that users do compaction during off-peak hours (for example, early morning). NebulaGraph has two types of compaction : automatic compaction and full compaction . Automatic compaction \u00b6 Automatic compaction is automatically triggered when the system reads data, writes data, or the system restarts. The read performance can increase in a short time. Automatic compaction is enabled by default. But once triggered during peak hours, it can cause unexpected IO occupancy that has an unwanted effect on the performance. Full compaction \u00b6 Full compaction enables large-scale background operations for a graph space such as merging files, deleting the data expired by TTL. This operation needs to be initiated manually.

The edges can be outgoing or incoming. Super vertices are very common because of the power-law distribution. For example, popular leaders in social networks (Internet celebrities), top stocks in the stock market, Big Four in the banking system, hubs in transportation networks, websites with high clicking rates on the Internet, and best sellers in E-commerce. In NebulaGraph 3.5.0, a vertex and its properties form a key-value pair , with its VID and other meta information as the key . Its Out-Edge Key-Value and In-Edge Key-Value are stored in the same partition in the form of LSM-trees in hard disks and caches. Therefore, directed traversals from this vertex and directed traversals ending at this vertex both involve either a large number of sequential IO scans (ideally, after Compaction or a large number of random IO (frequent writes to the vertex and its ingoing and outgoing edges ). As a rule of thumb, a vertex is considered dense when the number of its edges exceeds 10,000. Some special cases require additional consideration. Note In NebulaGraph 3.5.0, there is not any data structure to store the out/in degree for each vertex. Therefore, there is no direct method to know whether it is a super vertex or not. You can try to use Spark to count the degrees periodically. Indexes for duplicate properties \u00b6 In a property graph, there is another class of cases similar to super vertices: a property has a very high duplication rate , i.e., many vertices with the same tag but different VIDs have identical property and property values. Property indexes in NebulaGraph 3.5.0 are designed to reuse the functionality of RocksDB in the Storage Service, in which case indexes are modeled as keys with the same prefix . If the lookup of a property fails to hit the cache, it is processed as a random seek and a sequential prefix scan on the hard disk to find the corresponding VID. After that, the graph is usually traversed from this vertex, so that another random read and sequential scan for the corresponding key-value of this vertex will be triggered. The higher the duplication rate, the larger the scan range. For more information about property indexes, see How indexing works in NebulaGraph . Usually, special design and processing are required when the number of duplicate property values exceeds 10,000. Suggested solutions \u00b6 Solutions at the database end \u00b6 Truncation : Only return a certain number (a threshold) of edges, and do not return other edges exceeding this threshold. Compact : Reorganize the order of data in RocksDB to reduce random reads and increase sequential reads. Solutions at the application end \u00b6 Break up some of the super vertices according to their business significance: Delete multiple edges and merge them into one. For example, in the transfer scenario (Account_A)-[TRANSFER]->(Account_B) , each transfer record is modeled as an edge between account A and account B, then there may be tens of thousands of transfer records between (Account_A) and (Account_B) . In such scenarios, merge obsolete transfer details on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. That is, batch-delete old edges and replace them with a small number of edges representing monthly total and times . And keep the transfer details of the latest month. Split an edge into multiple edges of different types. For example, in the (Airport)<-[DEPART]-(Flight) scenario, the departure of each flight is modeled as an edge between a flight and an airport. Departures from a big airport might be enormous. According to different airlines, divide the DEPART edge type into finer edge types, such as DEPART_CEAIR , DEPART_CSAIR , etc. Specify the departing airline in queries (graph traversal). Split vertices. For example, in the loan network (person)-[BORROW]->(bank) , large bank A will have a very large number of loans and borrowers. In such scenarios, you can split the large vertex A into connected sub-vertices A1, A2, and A3. (Person1)-[BORROW]->(BankA1), (Person2)-[BORROW]->(BankA2), (Person2)-[BORROW]->(BankA3); (BankA1)-[BELONGS_TO]->(BankA), (BankA2)-[BELONGS_TO]->(BankA), (BankA3)-[BELONGS_TO]->(BankA). A1, A2, and A3 can either be three real branches of bank A, such as Beijing branch, Shanghai branch, and Zhejiang branch, or three virtual branches set up according to certain rules, such as A1: 1-1000, A2: 1001-10000 and A3: 10000+ according to the number of loans. In this way, any operation on A is converted into three separate operations on A1, A2, and A3.","title":"Processing super vertices"},{"location":"8.service-tuning/super-node/#processing_super_vertices","text":"","title":"Processing super vertices"},{"location":"8.service-tuning/super-node/#principle_introduction","text":"In graph theory, a super vertex, also known as a dense vertex, is a vertex with an extremely high number of adjacent edges.

You can use an LM client that communicates with the LM service to load license keys and view license information, including the license validity period and purchased nodes. By configuring the LM service address in the NebulaGraph database and its associated software, the validity of the license can be verified to ensure the normal use of the NebulaGraph database and its associated software. This article introduces how to deploy and use an LM service in a Linux environment and how to configure it within the Nebula Graph database and its associated software. For information on how to deploy the LM in a K8s cluster, see Deploy LM . Preparations \u00b6 To use an LM, you need to make sure the following: You have purchased a NebulaGraph license . You have obtained the desired LM installation package. Note LM installation packages are sent to you by email after you purchase a license. LM uses 9119 as the default port, make sure that port is not occupied. Notes \u00b6 An LM is a single-process service. To ensure the reliability and continuity of the LM, it is recommended that you use systemd to manage the LM and set a restart policy for the LM. The time on the LM server must be synchronized with the services (including the NebulaGraph database and associated software) connected to the LM. If the times are not in sync, license verification will fail, which can prevent the service from being used. Install and start LM \u00b6 An LM can be installed on Linux amd64 or arm64 systems, or installed through Dashboard. Using the TAR Package \u00b6 Unpack the LM TAR package. tar -zxvf <name.tar.gz> -C <path> <name.tar.gz> : The name of the LM TAR package. <path> : The installation path for the unpacked LM. If the -C parameter is not specified, it defaults to the current directory. Start the LM service using systemd. Create the LM service file /etc/systemd/system/nebula-license-manager.service with the following contents: [ Unit ] Description = License Manager [ Service ] Type = simple ExecStart = <path>/nebula-license-manager/nebula-license-manager WorkingDirectory = <path>/nebula-license-manager Restart = always [ Install ] WantedBy = multi-user.target <path> : Refers to the directory where the LM package is extracted. Start the LM service: sudo systemctl start nebula-license-manager Set up LM to start automatically on boot. sudo systemctl enable nebula-license-manager Using the RPM package \u00b6 Unpack the LM RPM package. sudo rpm -ivh <name.rpm> <name.rpm> : The name of the LM RPM package. The default installation path is /usr/local/nebula-license-manager , which cannot be changed. Start LM. sudo systemctl start nebula-license-manager Set up LM to start automatically on boot. sudo systemctl enable nebula-license-manager Using the DEB package \u00b6 Unpack the LM DEB package. sudo dpkg -i <name.deb> <name.deb> : The name of the LM DEB package. The default installation path is /usr/local/nebula-license-manager , which cannot be changed. Start LM. sudo systemctl start nebula-license-manager Set up LM to start automatically on boot. sudo systemctl enable nebula-license-manager Using Dashboard \u00b6 LM can be installed and started through Dashboard. For more information, see Connect to Dashboard . View LM configuration file \u00b6 The configuration file name for LM is nebula-license-manager.yaml . For RPM and DEB packages, the default path is /usr/local/nebula-license-manager/etc/nebula-license-manager.yaml . For the TAR package, the path is nebula-license-manager/etc/nebula-license-manager.yaml under the LM installation directory. The contents of the LM configuration file are as follows: Name : nebula-license-manager Host : 0.0.0.0 # The host address LM binds to. Port : 9119 # The port number LM listens on. The default is 9119. Timeout : 3000 # The timeout period for LM waiting for client requests, in milliseconds. The default is 3000 milliseconds. DataPath : data # The path for storing LM status data.

Synchronize license info \u00b6 When the license key loaded into LM is in online mode, the LM periodically synchronizes the license information from LC every one to two hours. You can also manually synchronize the license key using the following command. ./nebula-license-manager-cli sync Check the license quota usage \u00b6 You can run the following command to check the current usage of the license quota (the number of nodes purchased) and the usage status of the associated software. ./nebula-license-manager-cli usage View the license information on a specified LM \u00b6 For a database administrator (DBA), there may be a need to view the license information on a specified LM. To achieve this, run the following command: ./nebula-license-manager-cli <command> --addr <host>:9119 <command> : The command to be executed. Options include info , usage , sync , and load --key <license-key> --force . <host> : The IP address of the host where the specified LM is located. Monitor LM \u00b6 Monitor LM status \u00b6 You can use monitoring tools to monitor the status of the LM service. Use Dashboard Enterprise When LM is running normally, the License Manager page displays the status of LM as Running , otherwise, it displays Exited . For more information, see License Manager . Use Prometheus You need to configure the Prometheus server before monitoring LM. Add the following configuration to the Prometheus configuration file. For more information about the Prometheus configuration file, see Prometheus Configuration . ... - job_name : license-manager scrape_interval : 15s # The interval for pulling data. metrics_path : /metrics # The monitoring metrics path of LM, which is `/metrics`. scheme : http # The protocol type of LM, which is HTTP. static_configs : # The address and port of LM (default 9119). - targets : - [ <ip : lm_port> ] ... After the configuration is complete, you can monitor the status of LM through its built-in metric up . If the value is 1 , it means that LM is running normally; if the value is 0 , it means that LM is not running. To view the metric, enter up in the Prometheus query box as shown below: up{instance=\"<ip:lm_port>\", job=\"job_name\"} <ip:lm_port> : The IP address and port of LM. job_name : The name of the job. For example, up{instance=\"192.168.8.xxx:9119\", job=\"license-manager\"}. Note By default, LM uses port 9119 . If you need to change the port number, you can modify the value of the Port field in the LM configuration file above, or modify the value of port in the YAML file of Deploying LM in K8s . View LM metrics \u00b6 You can view the built-in metrics of LM through the following URL: http://<ip:lm_port>/metrics <ip:lm_port> : The IP address and port of LM. You can also collect LM metrics data through monitoring tools. To use Prometheus, you need to configure the Prometheus server before collecting LM metrics. For more information, see the above section Monitor LM status . Configure connection to LM \u00b6 Configure LM in NebulaGraph \u00b6 In the NebulaGraph database Meta service configuration file ( nebula-metad.conf ), set the license_manager_url value to reflect the IP address of the LM host and port number 9119 in the format like 192.168.8.xxx:9119 . For more information, see Meta service configuration . After the configuration is complete, restart the Meta service . Configure LM in Explorer \u00b6 In the Explorer installation directory, enter the config folder and modify the app-config.yaml file.

Set the value of license_manager_url to the IP address of the LM host and the port number 9119 , for example, 192.168.8.xxx:9119 . After the configuration is complete, run ./run_pagerank.sh in the scripts folder to start the Analytics service. For more information, see NebulaGraph Analytics . Configure LM in NebulaGraph Operator \u00b6 When deploying the cluster using Kubectl, configure the address and port of the LM through the spec.metad.licenseManagerURL field in the cluster configuration file. For more details, see Deploying with Kubectl . When deploying the cluster using Helm, specify the address and port of the LM with --set nebula.metad.licenseManagerURL . For more details, see Deploying with Helm . FAQ \u00b6 Q: Can I change the host on which my LM is located? A: No. The LM is bound to the host where it is installed. If you need to change the host, or the host is unable to be used, you need to contact Vesoft sales to rebind the LMID.","title":"License Manager"},{"location":"9.about-license/2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager/#license_manager","text":"A License Manager (LM) is an essential service that runs on a server for you to manage your license and license the NebulaGraph enterprise edition database and its associated software.

Features \u00b6 The BR has the following features. It supports: Backing up and restoring data in a one-click operation. Restoring data in the following backup file types: Local Disk (SSD or HDD). It is recommend to use local disk in test environment only. Amazon S3 compatible interface, such as Alibaba Cloud OSS, MinIO,Ceph RGW, etc. Backing up and restoring the entire NebulaGraph cluster. Backing up data of specified graph spaces (experimental). Limitations \u00b6 Supports NebulaGraph v3.x only. Supports full backup, but not incremental backup. Currently, NebulaGraph Listener and full-text indexes do not support backup. If you back up data to the local disk, the backup files will be saved in the local path of each server. You can also mount the NFS on your host to restore the backup data to a different host. During the backup process, both DDL and DML statements in any specified graph spaces are blocked. We recommend that you do the operation within the low peak period of the business, for example, from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM. The backup graph space can be restored to the original cluster only. Cross clusters restoration is not supported. Make sure the number of hosts in the cluster is not changed. Restoring a specified graph space will delete all other graph spaces in the cluster. Restoration requires that the number of the storage servers in the original cluster is the same as that of the storage servers in the target cluster and storage server IPs must be the same. Restoring the specified space will clear all the remaining spaces in the cluster. During the restoration process, there is a time when NebulaGraph stops running.

You can perform full backups and incremental backups. You can also back up data to your local disks and to cloud storage services compatible with the Amazon S3 interface. This topic introduces how to back up NebulaGraph data. Background \u00b6 A full backup is a backup of your NebulaGraph database's entire. An incremental backup covers all files that have changed or been modified since the last backup was made. The last backup can be either a full backup or an incremental backup. For the data directory structure of NebulaGraph, see the (default) path usr/local/nebula-ent/data . Notes \u00b6 During the process of data backup, DDL and DML statements in all specified graph spaces are blocked. We recommend that you perform the backup operation during the low business peak period. If you back up data to a local disk, the backup files will be saved in the local storage path of each server in a NebulaGraph cluster. You can also mount the NFS on your server to restore the backup data to a different server. During the process of a full backup, it may take a long time if the amount of the data to be backed up is large. The cluster performing an incremental backup needs to be the same as the cluster specified for the previous backup. The storage path of the incremental backup should also be the same as the path of the previous backup. Make sure that the time between each incremental backup and the last backup is less than a wal_ttl time. Make sure that Agent has read and write permissions for the corresponding NebulaGraph cluster installation directory and backup directory. Not support backup for Listener . Not support backup for full-text indexes. Not support backup for data of a specified graph space. Prerequisites \u00b6 The NebulaGraph services are running. You have installed BR Enterprise Edition and Agent , and have started the Agent(s) that are installed in each machine. You have created a directory with the same absolute path on the machines where the meta service, storage service, and the BR Enterprise Edition tool are located. Make sure your account has write privileges for this directory. Full backups \u00b6 To a cloud storage service \u00b6 Note You can back up data to the cloud storage services that are compatible with the Amazon S3 interface. In the directory of the BR Enterprise Edition installation tool, run the following command to back up the entire data of your NebulaGraph database to a cloud storage service: ./br backup full --meta <ip_address:port> --s3.access_key <access_key> --s3.secret_key <secret_key> --s3.region <region_name> --storage s3://<storage_path> --s3.endpoint <endpoint_url> For example, perform a full backup of the entire cluster where one of the meta service addresses is 192.168.8.129:9559 , and back up data to the / directory in the nebula-br-test bucket of Amazon S3. ./br backup full --meta 192.168.8.129:9559 --s3.access_key QImbbGDjfQExxx --s3.secret_key dVSJZfl7tnoFq7Z5zt6sfxxxx --s3.region us-east-1 --storage s3://nebula-br-test/ --s3.endpoint http://192.168.8.xxx:9000/ To a local disk \u00b6 Caution In the production environment, we recommend that you mount NFS (Network File System) to the machines where the meta service, the storage service, and the BR Enterprise Edition tool are located for local backups, or use Alibaba Cloud OSS, and Amazon S3 for cloud backups. Otherwise, you must manually move these backup files to the specified directory before restoring the data. For local backups, only the data of the leader mated and the leader partitions are backed up. When the shared storage service is not used and there are multiple metads or the replica number of partitions is greater than 1, you need to manually copy the directory of the backed-up leader metad ( <storage_path>/meta ) and overwrite the corresponding directories of other follower metads, and copy the corresponding partition data from the directory of the leader partitions ( <storage_path>/<partition_id> ) to the corresponding directories of other follower partitions. It is not recommended for you to have the copy operation. In the directory of the BR Enterprise Edition installation tool, run the following command to back up the entire data of your NebulaGraph database to a local disk: Note Make sure you have created a directory where your data to be backed up. ./br backup full --meta <ip_address:port> --storage local://<storage_path> For example, perform a full backup of the entire cluster where one of the meta server addresses is 192.168.8.129:9559 , and back up data to the /backup/ directory on the local disk. ./br backup full --meta \"192.168.8.129:9559\" --storage \"local:///backup/\" Directory structure \u00b6 Full backups back up all the data of the leader metad and leader partitions.

Clustering Jaccard Jaccard similarity Similarity Install NebulaGraph Analytics \u00b6 Install the NebulaGraph Analytics. When installing a cluster of multiple NebulaGraph Analytics on multiple nodes, you need to install NebulaGraph Analytics to the same path and set up SSH-free login between nodes. sudo rpm -ivh <analytics_package_name> --prefix <install_path> sudo chown <user>:<user> -R <install path> For example: sudo rpm -ivh nebula-analytics-3.5.0-centos.x86_64.rpm --prefix=/home/vesoft/nebula-analytics sudo chown vesoft:vesoft -R /home/vesoft/nebula-analytics Configure the correct Hadoop path and JDK path in the file set_env.sh , the file path is nebula-analytics/scripts/set_env.sh . If there are multiple machines, ensure that the paths are the same. Note The default TCP port range used by the MPICH process manager and MPICH library is 10000 to 10100. To adjust this, modify the value of the environment variable MPIR_CVAR_CH3_PORT_RANGE in the set_env.sh file. export HADOOP_HOME=<hadoop_path> export JAVA_HOME=<java_path> Configure the analytics.conf file with the path nebula-analytics/scripts/analytics.conf .

It's important to note that these methods are not interchangeable. For instance, you can't start the service using the dashboard.service script and then use the systemctl command to stop it. You can use the dashboard.service script to start, restart, stop, and check the Dashboard services. sudo <dashboard_path>/scripts/dashboard.service [ -v ] [ -h ] [ -version ] <start | restart | stop | status> <prometheus | webserver | exporter | gateway | all> Parameter Description dashboard_path Dashboard installation path. -v Display detailed debugging information. -h Display help information. -version Display the Dashboard version. start Start the target services. restart Restart the target services. stop Stop the target services. status Check the status of the target services. prometheus Set the prometheus Service as the target service. webserver Set the webserver Service as the target service. exporter Set the exporter Service as the target service. gateway Set the gateway Service as the target service. all Set all the Dashboard services as the target services. For example, if Dashboard is installed in the current directory, you can manage its services using the following commands: sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service start all # Start Dashboard. sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service stop all # Stop Dashboard. sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service status all # Check Dashboard status. sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service restart all # Restart Dashboard. If you installed Dashboard using RPM or DEB packages, you can manage the service using systemd. You can start, view, restart and stop the service using the systemctl command. sudo systemctl start nebula-dashboard.target # Start all service. sudo systemctl status nebula-dashboard.target # Check Dashboard status. sudo systemctl restart <nbd-prometheus.service | nbd-alert-manager.service | nbd-stats-exporter.service | nbd-webserver.service> # Restart service respectively. sudo systemctl stop <nbd-prometheus.service | nbd-alert-manager.service | nbd-stats-exporter.service | nbd-webserver.service> # Stop service respectively. For example, to stop the Prometheus service, run the following command: sudo systemctl stop nbd-prometheus.service View logs \u00b6 Users who manage services using dashboard.service can view the Dashboard Enterprise Edition logs in the logs directory. For example: cat logs/prometheus.log The descriptions of the log files are as follows. Log file Description alertmanager.log Alertmanager service log. nebula-stats-exporter.log nebula-stats-exporter service log. prometheus.log Prometheus service log. br Backup and restore service log. webserver.log Dashboard service log.

You can use the search box in the help center or the search function of the browser to match the questions you are looking for. \"What are Cluster, Node, and Service?\" \u00b6 Cluster: refers to a group of systems composed of nodes where multiple NebulaGraph services are located. Node: refers to the physical or virtual machine hosting NebulaGraph services. Service: refers to NebulaGraph services, including Metad, Storaged, and Graphd services. \"What is the cluster status?\" \u00b6 The status of a cluster is as follows: installing: The cluster is being created. The process will take about 3 to 10 minutes. healthy: All services in the cluster are healthy. unhealthy: There is an unhealthy service in the cluster service. \"Why authorizing nodes?\" \u00b6 Managing clusters requires the SSH information of the corresponding node. Therefore, you need to have at least an SSH account and the corresponding password with executable permissions before performing operations on Dashboard. \"What is scaling?\" \u00b6 NebulaGraph is a distributed graph database that supports dynamic scaling services at runtime. Therefore, you can dynamically scale Storaged and Graphd services through Dashboard. The Metad service cannot be scaled. \"Why cannot operate on the Metad service?\" \u00b6 The Metad service stores the metadata of the NebulaGraph database. Once the Metad service fails to function, the entire cluster may break down. Besides, the amount of data processed by the Metad service is not much, so it is not recommended to scale the Metad service. And we directly disabled operating on the Metad service in Dashboard to prevent the cluster from being unavailable due to the misoperation of users. \"What impact will the scaling have on the data?\" \u00b6 Scale out the Storaged service: Dashboard will create and start the Storaged service on the specified machine, which will not affect the existing data. You can choose to perform Balance Leader in the Storage Leader Distribution area and Balance Data in the Partition Distribution area on the Information -> Overview Info page according to your own needs. Scale in the Storaged service: Dashboard will not scale in Storage services until you execute Balance Data Remove to migrate all the partitions from the specified Storage service to other Storage services in the Partition Distribution area on the Information -> Overview Info page. Scaling the Graphd service will not affect the data. \"Why Dashboard Enterprise Edition cannot be started?\" \u00b6 Make sure that the license key is loaded. Make sure that the license is not expired. You can also execute cat logs/webserver.log in the Dashboard directory to view the startup information of each module. If the above conditions are met but Dashboard still cannot be started, go to NebulaGraph Official Forum for consultation. \"Can I add the NebulaGraph installation package manually?\" \u00b6 You can add the installation package manually in Dashboard. To download the system and RPM/DEB package you need, see How to download NebulaGraph and add the package to nebula-dashboard-ent/download/nebula-graph . And you can select the added package for deployment when creating and scaling out a cluster. Why does it prompt \u201cSSH connection error\u201d when importing a cluster\uff1f \u00b6 If Service Host shows 127.0.0.1 , and your Dashboard and NebulaGraph are deployed on the same machine when authorizing service hosts, the system will prompt \"SSH connection error\u201d. You need to change the Host IP of each service to the real machine IP in the configuration files of all NebulaGraph services. For more information, see Configuration management . If you import a cluster deployed with Docker, it also prompts \"SSH connection error\".

The values of these four parameters can be adjusted appropriately according to the machine performance. If the leader of the Storage service changes during the import process, you can adjust the values of these four parameters to reduce the import speed. Others \u00b6 Q: Which versions of NebulaGraph are supported by Exchange? \u00b6 See Limitations . Q: What is the relationship between Exchange and Spark Writer? \u00b6 Exchange is the Spark application developed based on Spark Writer. Both are suitable for bulk migration of cluster data to NebulaGraph in a distributed environment, but later maintenance work will be focused on Exchange. Compared with Spark Writer, Exchange has the following improvements: It supports more abundant data sources, such as MySQL, Neo4j, Hive, HBase, Kafka, Pulsar, etc. It fixed some problems of Spark Writer. For example, when Spark reads data from HDFS, the default source data is String, which may be different from the NebulaGraph's Schema. So Exchange adds automatic data type matching and type conversion. When the data type in the NebulaGraph's Schema is non-String (e.g. double), Exchange converts the source data of String type to the corresponding type.","title":"Exchange FAQ"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/ex-ug-FAQ/#exchange_faq","text":"","title":"Exchange FAQ"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/ex-ug-FAQ/#compilation","text":"","title":"Compilation"},{"location":"nebula-exchange/ex-ug-FAQ/#q_some_packages_not_in_central_repository_failed_to_download_error_could_not_resolve_dependencies_for_project_xxx","text":"Please check the mirror part of Maven installation directory libexec/conf/settings.xml : <mirror> <id>alimaven</id> <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf> <name>aliyun maven</name> <url>http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/repositories/central/</url> </mirror> Check whether the value of mirrorOf is configured to * .

Exchange consists of Reader, Processor, and Writer. After Reader reads data from different sources and returns a DataFrame, the Processor iterates through each row of the DataFrame and obtains the corresponding value based on the mapping between fields in the configuration file. After iterating through the number of rows in the specified batch, Writer writes the captured data to the NebulaGraph at once. The following figure illustrates the process by which Exchange completes the data conversion and migration. Editions \u00b6 Exchange has two editions, the Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition. The Community Edition is open source developed on GitHub . The Enterprise Edition supports not only the functions of the Community Edition but also adds additional features. For details, see Comparisons . Scenarios \u00b6 Exchange applies to the following scenarios: Streaming data from Kafka and Pulsar platforms, such as log files, online shopping data, activities of game players, information on social websites, financial transactions or geospatial services, and telemetry data from connected devices or instruments in the data center, are required to be converted into the vertex or edge data of the property graph and import them into the NebulaGraph database. Batch data, such as data from a time period, needs to be read from a relational database (such as MySQL) or a distributed file system (such as HDFS), converted into vertex or edge data for a property graph, and imported into the NebulaGraph database. A large volume of data needs to be generated into SST files that NebulaGraph can recognize and then imported into the NebulaGraph database. The data saved in NebulaGraph needs to be exported. Enterpriseonly Exporting the data saved in NebulaGraph is supported by Exchange Enterprise Edition only. Advantages \u00b6 Exchange has the following advantages: High adaptability: It supports importing data into the NebulaGraph database in a variety of formats or from a variety of sources, making it easy to migrate data. SST import: It supports converting data from different sources into SST files for data import. SSL encryption: It supports establishing the SSL encryption between Exchange and NebulaGraph to ensure data security. Resumable data import: It supports resumable data import to save time and improve data import efficiency. Note Resumable data import is currently supported when migrating Neo4j data only. Asynchronous operation: An insert statement is generated in the source data and sent to the Graph service. Then the insert operation is performed. Great flexibility: It supports importing multiple Tags and Edge types at the same time. Different Tags and Edge types can be from different data sources or in different formats. Statistics: It uses the accumulator in Apache Spark\u2122 to count the number of successful and failed insert operations. Easy to use: It adopts the Human-Optimized Config Object Notation (HOCON) configuration file format and has an object-oriented style, which is easy to understand and operate.

If the vaue is false , ranks, source vertex IDs, destination vertex IDs, ranks, and the property data will be exported. edges.return.fields list [] Yes Specifies the properties to be exported. For example, to export start_year and end_year , you need to set the parameter value to [\"start_year\",\"end_year\"] .

Data set \u00b6 This topic takes the basketballplayer dataset as an example. Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone ClickHouse: docker deployment yandex/clickhouse-server tag: latest(2021.07.01) NebulaGraph: 3.5.0. Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: NebulaGraph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to NebulaGraph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. Learn about the Schema created in NebulaGraph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow .

To import a local CSV file to NebulaGraph, see NebulaGraph Importer . Data set \u00b6 This topic takes the basketballplayer dataset as an example. Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment NebulaGraph: 3.5.0. Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: NebulaGraph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to NebulaGraph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. Learn about the Schema created in NebulaGraph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. If files are stored in HDFS, ensure that the Hadoop service is running normally. If files are stored locally and NebulaGraph is a cluster architecture, you need to place the files in the same directory locally on each machine in the cluster. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Process CSV files \u00b6 Confirm the following information: Process CSV files to meet Schema requirements. Note Exchange supports uploading CSV files with or without headers. Obtain the CSV file storage path. Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set CSV data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called csv_application.conf .

Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment Hive: 2.3.7, Hive Metastore database is MySQL 8.0.22 NebulaGraph: 3.5.0. Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: NebulaGraph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to NebulaGraph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. Learn about the Schema created in NebulaGraph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. The Hive Metastore database (MySQL in this example) has been started. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Use Spark SQL to confirm Hive SQL statements \u00b6 After the Spark-shell environment is started, run the following statements to ensure that Spark can read data in Hive. scala > sql ( \"select playerid, age, name from basketball.player\" ). show scala > sql ( \"select teamid, name from basketball.team\" ). show scala > sql ( \"select src_player, dst_player, degree from basketball.follow\" ). show scala > sql ( \"select playerid, teamid, start_year, end_year from basketball.serve\" ). show The following is the result read from the table basketball.player . +---------+----+-----------------+ | playerid | age | name | +---------+----+-----------------+ | player100 | 42 | Tim Duncan | | player101 | 36 | Tony Parker | | player102 | 33 | LaMarcus Aldridge | | player103 | 32 | Rudy Gay | | player104 | 32 | Marco Belinelli | +---------+----+-----------------+ ...

The following are some of the data for each table. mysql > desc player ; + ----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | + ----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | playerid | int | YES | | NULL | | | age | int | YES | | NULL | | | name | varchar ( 30 ) | YES | | NULL | | + ----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ mysql > desc team ; + --------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | + --------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | teamid | int | YES | | NULL | | | name | varchar ( 30 ) | YES | | NULL | | + --------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ mysql > desc follow ; + ------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | + ------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | src_player | int | YES | | NULL | | | dst_player | int | YES | | NULL | | | degree | int | YES | | NULL | | + ------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ mysql > desc serve ; + ------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra | + ------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ | playerid | int | YES | | NULL | | | teamid | int | YES | | NULL | | | start_year | int | YES | | NULL | | | end_year | int | YES | | NULL | | + ------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+ Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone MySQL: 8.0.23 NebulaGraph: 3.5.0. Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: NebulaGraph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to NebulaGraph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. Learn about the Schema created in NebulaGraph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set JDBC data source configuration. In this case, the copied file is called jdbc_application.conf . For details on each configuration item, see Parameters in the configuration file . { # Spark configuration spark: { app: { name: NebulaGraph Exchange 3.5.0 } driver: { cores: 1 maxResultSize: 1G } cores: { max: 16 } } # NebulaGraph configuration nebula: { address:{ # Specify the IP addresses and ports for Graph and Meta services. # If there are multiple addresses, the format is \"ip1:port\",\"ip2:port\",\"ip3:port\". # Addresses are separated by commas. graph:[\"127.0.0.1:9669\"] # the address of any of the meta services. # if your NebulaGraph server is in virtual network like k8s, please config the leader address of meta. meta:[\"127.0.0.1:9559\"] } # The account entered must have write permission for the NebulaGraph space. user: root pswd: nebula # Fill in the name of the graph space you want to write data to in the NebulaGraph. space: basketballplayer connection: { timeout: 3000 retry: 3 } execution: { retry: 3 } error: { max: 32 output: /tmp/errors } rate: { limit: 1024 timeout: 1000 } } # Processing vertexes tags: [ # Set the information about the Tag player. { # The Tag name in NebulaGraph. name: player type: { # Specify the data source file format to JDBC. source: jdbc # Specify how to import the data into NebulaGraph: Client or SST. sink: client } # URL of the JDBC data source.

For a description of the parameters, see Options for import . ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange <nebula-exchange-3.5.0.jar_path> -c <jdbc_application.conf_path> Note JAR packages are available in two ways: compiled them yourself , or download the compiled .jar file directly. For example: ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/nebula-exchange-3.5.0.jar -c /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/classes/jdbc_application.conf You can search for batchSuccess.<tag_name/edge_name> in the command output to check the number of successes. For example, batchSuccess.follow: 300 . Step 4: (optional) Validate data \u00b6 Users can verify that data has been imported by executing a query in the NebulaGraph client (for example, NebulaGraph Studio). For example: LOOKUP ON player YIELD id(vertex); Users can also run the SHOW STATS command to view statistics. Step 5: (optional) Rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph \u00b6 With the data imported, users can recreate and rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph.

Compatibility Please use Exchange 3.5.0/3.3.0/3.0.0 when importing Kafka data. In version 3.4.0, caching of imported data was added, and streaming data import is not supported. Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone NebulaGraph: 3.5.0. Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: NebulaGraph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to NebulaGraph. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. The following JAR files have been downloaded and placed in the directory SPARK_HOME/jars of Spark: spark-streaming-kafka_xxx.jar spark-sql-kafka-0-10_xxx.jar kafka-clients-xxx.jar Learn about the Schema created in NebulaGraph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. The Kafka service has been installed and started. Precautions \u00b6 Only client mode is supported when importing Kafka data, i.e. the value of parameters tags.type.sink and edges.type.sink is client . Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Modify configuration files \u00b6 Note If some data is stored in Kafka's value field, you need to modify the source code, get the value from Kafka, parse the value through the from_JSON function, and return it as a Dataframe. After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set Kafka data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called kafka_application.conf . For details on each configuration item, see Parameters in the configuration file . Note When importing Kafka data, a configuration file can only handle one tag or edge type. If there are multiple tag or edge types, you need to create multiple configuration files. { # Spark configuration spark: { app: { name: NebulaGraph Exchange 3.5.0 } driver: { cores: 1 maxResultSize: 1G } cores: { max: 16 } } # NebulaGraph configuration nebula: { address:{ # Specify the IP addresses and ports for Graph and all Meta services. # If there are multiple addresses, the format is \"ip1:port\",\"ip2:port\",\"ip3:port\". # Addresses are separated by commas. graph:[\"127.0.0.1:9669\"] # the address of any of the meta services. # if your NebulaGraph server is in virtual network like k8s, please config the leader address of meta. meta:[\"127.0.0.1:9559\"] } # The account entered must have write permission for the NebulaGraph space. user: root pswd: nebula # Fill in the name of the graph space you want to write data to in the NebulaGraph. space: basketballplayer connection: { timeout: 3000 retry: 3 } execution: { retry: 3 } error: { max: 32 output: /tmp/errors } rate: { limit: 1024 timeout: 1000 } } # Processing vertexes tags: [ # Set the information about the Tag player. { # The corresponding Tag name in NebulaGraph. name: player type: { # Specify the data source file format to Kafka. source: kafka # Specify how to import the data into NebulaGraph.

Implementation method \u00b6 Exchange uses Neo4j Driver 4.0.1 to read Neo4j data. Before batch export, you need to write Cypher statements that are automatically executed based on labels and relationship types and the number of Spark partitions in the configuration file to improve data export performance. When Exchange reads Neo4j data, it needs to do the following: The Reader in Exchange replaces the statement following the Cypher RETURN statement in the exec part of the configuration file with COUNT(*) , and executes this statement to get the total amount of data, then calculates the starting offset and size of each partition based on the number of Spark partitions. (Optional) If the user has configured the check_point_path directory, Reader reads the files in the directory. In the transferring state, Reader calculates the offset and size that each Spark partition should have. In each Spark partition, the Reader in Exchange adds different SKIP and LIMIT statements to the Cypher statement and calls the Neo4j Driver for parallel execution to distribute data to different Spark partitions. The Reader finally processes the returned data into a DataFrame. At this point, Exchange has finished exporting the Neo4j data. The data is then written in parallel to the NebulaGraph database.

Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose . Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: NebulaGraph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with NebulaGraph write permission. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed.

Step 2: Configuring source data \u00b6 To speed up the export of Neo4j data, create indexes for the corresponding properties in the Neo4j database. For more information, refer to the Neo4j manual . Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set Neo4j data source configuration.

To prevent loss of data during import, it is strongly recommended to include ORDER BY clause in Cypher queries. Meanwhile, in order to improve data import efficiency, it is better to select indexed properties for ordering. If there is no index, users can also observe the default order and select the appropriate properties for ordering to improve efficiency. If the pattern of the default order cannot be found, users can order them by the ID of the vertex or relationship and set the partition to a small value to reduce the ordering pressure of Neo4j. Note Using the ORDER BY clause lengthens the data import time. Exchange needs to execute different SKIP and LIMIT Cypher statements on different Spark partitions, so SKIP and LIMIT clauses cannot be included in the Cypher statements corresponding to tags.exec and edges.exec . tags.vertex or edges.vertex configuration \u00b6 NebulaGraph uses ID as the unique primary key when creating vertexes and edges, overwriting the data in that primary key if it already exists. So, if a Neo4j property value is given as the NebulaGraph'S ID and the value is duplicated in Neo4j, duplicate IDs will be generated. One and only one of their corresponding data will be stored in the NebulaGraph, and the others will be overwritten. Because the data import process is concurrently writing data to NebulaGraph, the final saved data is not guaranteed to be the latest data in Neo4j. check_point_path configuration \u00b6 If breakpoint transfers are enabled, to avoid data loss, the state of the database should not change between the breakpoint and the transfer. For example, data cannot be added or deleted, and the partition quantity configuration should not be changed. Step 4: Import data into NebulaGraph \u00b6 Run the following command to import Neo4j data into NebulaGraph. For a description of the parameters, see Options for import . ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange <nebula-exchange-3.5.0.jar_path> -c <neo4j_application.conf_path> Note JAR packages are available in two ways: compiled them yourself , or download the compiled .jar file directly.

For example, batchSuccess.follow: 300 . Step 5: (optional) Validate data \u00b6 Users can verify that data has been imported by executing a query in the NebulaGraph client (for example, NebulaGraph Studio). For example: LOOKUP ON player YIELD id(vertex); Users can also run the SHOW STATS command to view statistics. Step 6: (optional) Rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph \u00b6 With the data imported, users can recreate and rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph.

Meanwhile, in order to improve data import efficiency, it is better to select indexed properties for ordering. If there is no index, users can also observe the default order and select the appropriate properties for ordering to improve efficiency. If the pattern of the default order cannot be found, users can order them by the ID of the vertex or relationship and set the partition to a small value to reduce the ordering pressure of Neo4j.

Learn about the Schema created in NebulaGraph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. If files are stored in HDFS, ensure that the Hadoop service is running properly. If files are stored locally and NebulaGraph is a cluster architecture, you need to place the files in the same directory locally on each machine in the cluster. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space. nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer. nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player. nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team. nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow. nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve. nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Process ORC files \u00b6 Confirm the following information: Process ORC files to meet Schema requirements. Obtain the ORC file storage path. Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set ORC data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called orc_application.conf . For details on each configuration item, see Parameters in the configuration file . { # Spark configuration spark: { app: { name: NebulaGraph Exchange 3.5.0 } driver: { cores: 1 maxResultSize: 1G } executor: { memory:1G } cores: { max: 16 } } # NebulaGraph configuration nebula: { address:{ # Specify the IP addresses and ports for Graph and all Meta services. # If there are multiple addresses, the format is \"ip1:port\",\"ip2:port\",\"ip3:port\". # Addresses are separated by commas. graph:[\"127.0.0.1:9669\"] # the address of any of the meta services. # if your NebulaGraph server is in virtual network like k8s, please config the leader address of meta. meta:[\"127.0.0.1:9559\"] } # The account entered must have write permission for the NebulaGraph space. user: root pswd: nebula # Fill in the name of the graph space you want to write data to in the NebulaGraph. space: basketballplayer connection: { timeout: 3000 retry: 3 } execution: { retry: 3 } error: { max: 32 output: /tmp/errors } rate: { limit: 1024 timeout: 1000 } } # Processing vertexes tags: [ # Set the information about the Tag player. { name: player type: { # Specify the data source file format to ORC. source: orc # Specify how to import the data into NebulaGraph: Client or SST. sink: client } # Specify the path to the ORC file. # If the file is stored in HDFS, use double quotation marks to enclose the file path, starting with hdfs://.

The sample data source is a CSV file. Precautions \u00b6 The SST file can be imported only in Linux. The default value of the property is not supported. Background information \u00b6 Exchange supports two data import modes: Import the data from the data source directly into NebulaGraph as nGQL statements. Generate the SST file from the data source, and use Console to import the SST file into NebulaGraph. The following describes the scenarios, implementation methods, prerequisites, and steps for generating an SST file and importing data. Scenarios \u00b6 Suitable for online services, because the generation almost does not affect services (just reads the Schema), and the import speed is fast. Caution Although the import speed is fast, write operations in the corresponding space are blocked during the import period (about 10 seconds). Therefore, you are advised to import data in off-peak hours. Suitable for scenarios with a large amount of data from data sources for its fast import speed. Implementation methods \u00b6 The underlying code in NebulaGraph uses RocksDB as the key-value storage engine. RocksDB is a storage engine based on the hard disk, providing a series of APIs for creating and importing SST files to help quickly import massive data. The SST file is an internal file containing an arbitrarily long set of ordered key-value pairs for efficient storage of large amounts of key-value data. The entire process of generating SST files is mainly done by Exchange Reader, sstProcessor, and sstWriter. The whole data processing steps are as follows: Reader reads data from the data source. sstProcessor generates the SST file from the NebulaGraph's Schema information and uploads it to the HDFS. For details about the format of the SST file, see Data Storage Format . sstWriter opens a file and inserts data. When generating SST files, keys must be written in sequence. After the SST file is generated, RocksDB imports the SST file into NebulaGraph using the IngestExternalFile() method. For example: IngestExternalFileOptions ifo; # Import two SST files Status s = db_->IngestExternalFile({\"/home/usr/file1.sst\", \"/home/usr/file2.sst\"}, ifo); if (!s.ok()) { printf(\"Error while adding file %s and %s, Error %s\\n\", file_path1.c_str(), file_path2.c_str(), s.ToString().c_str()); return 1; } When the IngestExternalFile() method is called, RocksDB copies the file to the data directory by default and blocks the RocksDB write operation. If the key range in the SST file overwrites the Memtable key range, flush the Memtable to the hard disk. After placing the SST file in an optimal location in the LSM tree, assign a global serial number to the file and turn on the write operation. Data set \u00b6 This topic takes the basketballplayer dataset as an example. Environment \u00b6 This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information: Hardware specifications: CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment NebulaGraph: 3.5.0. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information: NebulaGraph has been installed and deployed with the following information: IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services. The user name and password with write permission to NebulaGraph. --ws_storage_http_port in the Meta service configuration file is the same as --ws_http_port in the Storage service configuration file. For example, 19779 . --ws_meta_http_port in the Graph service configuration file is the same as --ws_http_port in the Meta service configuration file. For example, 19559 . The information about the Schema, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more. Exchange has been compiled , or download the compiled .jar file directly. Spark has been installed. JDK 1.8 or the later version has been installed and the environment variable JAVA_HOME has been configured. The Hadoop service has been installed and started. Note To generate SST files of other data sources, see documents of the corresponding data source and check the prerequisites. To generate SST files only, users do not need to install the Hadoop service on the machine where the Storage service is deployed. To delete the SST file after the ingest (data import) operation, add the configuration -- move_Files =true to the Storage Service configuration file. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph \u00b6 Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps: Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table. Element Name Property Tag player name string, age int Tag team name string Edge Type follow degree int Edge Type serve start_year int, end_year int Create a graph space basketballplayer in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below. ## Create a graph space nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \\ (partition_num = 10, \\ replica_factor = 1, \\ vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); ## Use the graph space basketballplayer nebula> USE basketballplayer; ## Create the Tag player nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int); ## Create the Tag team nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string); ## Create the Edge type follow nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int); ## Create the Edge type serve nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int); For more information, see Quick start workflow . Step 2: Process CSV files \u00b6 Confirm the following information: Process CSV files to meet Schema requirements. Note Exchange supports uploading CSV files with or without headers. Obtain the CSV file storage path. Step 3: Modify configuration files \u00b6 After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file target/classes/application.conf to set SST data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called sst_application.conf .

For a description of the parameters, see Options for import . ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partition = <shuffle_concurrency> --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange <nebula-exchange-3.5.0.jar_path> -c <sst_application.conf_path> Note When generating SST files, the shuffle operation of Spark will be involved. Note that the configuration of spark.sql.shuffle.partition should be added when you submit the command. Note JAR packages are available in two ways: compiled them yourself , or download the compiled .jar file directly. For example: ${ SPARK_HOME } /bin/spark-submit --master \"local\" --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partition = 200 --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/nebula-exchange-3.5.0.jar -c /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/classes/sst_application.conf After the task is complete, you can view the generated SST file in the /sst directory (specified by the nebula.path.remote parameter) on HDFS. Note If you modify the Schema, such as rebuilding the graph space, modifying the Tag, or modifying the Edge type, you need to regenerate the SST file because the SST file verifies the space ID, Tag ID, and Edge ID. Step 5: Import the SST file \u00b6 Note Confirm the following information before importing: Confirm that the Hadoop service has been deployed on all the machines where the Storage service is deployed, and configure HADOOP_HOME and JAVA_HOME . The --ws_storage_http_port in the Meta service configuration file (add it manually if it does not exist) is the same as the --ws_http_port in the Storage service configuration file. For example, both are 19779 . The --ws_meta_http_port in the Graph service configuration file (add it manually if it does not exist) is the same as the --ws_http_port in the Meta service configuration file. For example, both are 19559 . Connect to the NebulaGraph database using the client tool and import the SST file as follows: Run the following command to select the graph space you created earlier. nebula> USE basketballplayer; Run the following command to download the SST file: nebula> SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS \"hdfs://<hadoop_address>:<hadoop_port>/<sst_file_path>\"; For example: nebula> SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS \"hdfs://*.*.*.*:9000/sst\"; Run the following command to import the SST file: nebula> SUBMIT JOB INGEST; Note To download the SST file again, delete the download folder in the space ID in the data/storage/nebula directory in the NebulaGraph installation path, and then download the SST file again. If the space has multiple copies, the download folder needs to be deleted on all machines where the copies are saved. If there is a problem with the import and re-importing is required, re-execute SUBMIT JOB INGEST; . Step 6: (optional) Validate data \u00b6 Users can verify that data has been imported by executing a query in the NebulaGraph client (for example, NebulaGraph Studio). For example: LOOKUP ON player YIELD id(vertex); Users can also run the SHOW STATS command to view statistics. Step 7: (optional) Rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph \u00b6 With the data imported, users can recreate and rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph.

You can use the search box in the help center or the search function of the browser to match the questions you are looking for. Will the Dag Controller service crash if the Graph service returns too much result data? \u00b6 The Dag Controller service only provides scheduling capabilities and will not crash, but the NebulaGraph Analytics service may crash due to insufficient memory when writing too much data to HDFS or NebulaGraph, or reading too much data from HDFS or NebulaGraph. Can I continue a job from a failed task? \u00b6 Not supported. You can only re-execute the entire job. How can I speed it up if a task result is saved slowly or data is transferred slowly between tasks? \u00b6 The Dag Controller contains graph query components and graph computing components. Graph queries send requests to a graph service for queries, so the graph queries can only be accelerated by increasing the memory of the graph service. Graph computing is performed on distributed nodes provided by NebulaGraph Analytics, so graph computing can be accelerated by increasing the size of the NebulaGraph Analytics cluster. The HDFS server cannot be connected and the task status is running. \u00b6 Set the timeout period for HDFS connections as follows: <configuration> <property> <name>ipc.client.connect.timeout</name> <value>3000</value> </property> <property> <name>ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts</name> <value>3</value> </property> </configuration> How to resolve the error Err:dial unix: missing address ? \u00b6 Modify the configuration file dag-ctrl/etc/dag-ctrl-api.yaml to configure the UserName of the SSH. How to resolve the error bash: /home/xxx/nebula-analytics/scripts/run_algo.sh: No such file or directory ? \u00b6 Modify the configuration file dag-ctrl/etc/tasks.yaml to configure the algorithm execution path parameter exec_file . How to resolve the error /lib64/libm.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /home/vesoft/jdk-18.0.1/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so) ? \u00b6 Because the operating system version does not support JDK18, the command YUM cannot download GLIBC_2.29 , you can install JDK1.8. Does not forget to change the JDK address in nebula-analytics/scripts/set_env.sh . How to resolve the error handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey], no supported methods remain ? \u00b6 Reconfigure the permissions to 744 on the folder .ssh and 600 on the file .ssh/authorized_keys . How to resolve the error There are 0 NebulaGraph Analytics available. clusterSize should be less than or equal to it ? \u00b6 Check according to the following procedure: Check whether the configuration of SSH password-free login between nodes is successful. You can run the ssh <user_name>@<node_ip> command on the Dag Controller machine to check whether the login succeeds. Note If the Dag Controller and Analytics are on the same machine, you also need to configure SSH password-free login. Check the configuration file of the Dag Controller. Check whether the SSH user in etc/dag-ctrl-api.yaml is the same as the user who starts the Dag Controller service and the user who configs SSH password-free login. Check whether the algorithm path in etc/tasks.yaml is correct. Check whether Hadoop and Java paths in scripts/set_env.sh are correct. Restart the Dag Controller for the settings to take effect. How to resolve the error no available namenodes: dial tcp xx.xx.xx.xx:8020: connect: connection timed out ? \u00b6 Check whether the HDFS namenode port 8020 is open.

Parameter Description Auto Weight Degree\uff1aAutomatically resizes vertices according to the number of outgoing and incoming edges of all the vertices on the canvas. Reset Degree\uff1aResets the vertices on the canvas to their original size. Edge Aggregation: Automatically aggregate all edges on the canvas that match the aggregation rules. Edge Disaggregate: Resets the aggregated edges on the canvas. Detection Outlier: Detects the vertices that connect no edges on a canvas. Hang Edge: Detects edges associated with vertices of one degree in the canvas (associated vertices are included). Loop Detection: Detects the paths that connect a vertex to itself. N-Step Vertex Detection: Starting from the selected vertex, the vertices in the outbound direction are displayed on the canvas hop by hop. Aggregation Aggregate the edges between the vertices: Aggregate the edges between the selected vertices on the canvas. Cancels aggregation of edges between vertices: Resets the aggregated edges between the selected vertices on the canvas. Edit Dismiss: Hide the selected vertices and edges on the canvas.

Prerequisites \u00b6 Before deploying Explorer, you must check the following information: The license key is loaded. The NebulaGraph services are deployed and started. For more information, see NebulaGraph Database Manual . Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied. Port Description 7002 Web service provided by Explorer Caution By default, Explorer uses the port 7002 . You can modify the httpport in the conf/app.conf file in the installation directory and restart the service. The Linux distribution is CentOS. Precautions \u00b6 The Dag Controller installation package is built in Explorer starting from version 3.2.0, which provides graph computing services. The user can decide whether or not to start the Dag Controller service. If the Dag Controller service is not started, the Workflow menu in Explorer will appear gray and cannot be clicked. In addition, if you need to use Workflow for complex graph computing, you need to configure NFS or HDFS after installing Explorer. Namenode uses port 8020 by default, and datanode uses port 50010 by default. For details, see Prepare resources of Workflow . Enterpriseonly You can apply online for Explorer free trial. NebulaGraph Explorer Enterprise Edition is available exclusively through our Enterprise Edition package and is not sold separately. Contact us for details. RPM-based deployment \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 Select and download the RPM package according to your needs. It is recommended to select the latest version. Use sudo rpm -i <rpm> to install RPM package. For example, use the following command to install Explorer. The default installation path is /usr/local/nebula-explorer . sudo rpm -i nebula-explorer-<version>.x86_64.rpm You can also install it to the specified path using the following command: sudo rpm -i nebula-explorer-<version>.x86_64.rpm --prefix = <path> Enter the extracted folder, and modify the app-config.yaml file in the config directory, set the value of LicenseManagerURL to the host IP of LM and the port number 9119 , for example, 192.168.8.100:9119 . (Optional) Configure the Dag Controller. See the Configure Dag Controller section below. Enter the folder nebula-explorer , and start the service using the following command. cd nebula-explorer # Start Explorer. sudo ./scripts/start.sh # (Optional) Start Dag Controller. sudo ./dag-ctrl/scripts/start.sh Start and stop \u00b6 You can use SystemCTL to start and stop the service. systemctl status nebula-explorer #Check the status systemctl stop nebula-explorer #Stop the service systemctl start nebula-explorer #Start the service You can also start or stop the service manually using the following command in the installation directory. sudo ./scripts/start.sh #Start Explorer sudo ./scripts/stop.sh #Stop Explorer sudo ./dag-ctrl/scripts/start.sh #Start Dag Controller sudo ./dag-ctrl/scripts/stop.sh #Stop Dag Controller Uninstallation \u00b6 You can uninstall Explorer using the following command: sudo rpm -e nebula-graph-explorer-<version>.x86_64 DEB-based deployment \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 Select and download the RPM package according to your needs. It is recommended to select the latest version. Common links are as follows: Run sudo dpkg -i <package_name> to unpack the DEB package. For example, run the following command to install Explorer (The default installation path is /usr/local/nebula-explorer ). sudo dpkg -i nebula-explorer-3.5.0.x86_64.deb Note You cannot customize the installation path of Explorer when installing a DEB package. Enter the extracted folder, and modify the app-config.yaml file in the config directory, set the value of LicenseManagerURL to the host IP of LM and the port number 9119 , for example, 192.168.8.100:9119 . (Optional) Configure the Dag Controller. See the Configure Dag Controller section below.

The job consists of multiple tasks to form a directed acyclic graph, and there is a dependency between the tasks. The Dag Controller can perform complex graph computing with NebulaGraph Analytics. For example, the Dag Controller sends an algorithm request to NebulaGraph Analytics, which saves the result to NebulaGraph or HDFS. The Dag Controller then takes the result as input to the next algorithmic task to create a new task. Steps \u00b6 Complete the SSH password-free configurations so that the Dag Controller machine can log directly into the NebulaGraph Analytics machines and all machines within the NebulaGraph Analytics cluster can connect directly to each other without passwords. For example, the user in machine A (Dag Controller) logs directly into machine B-1 in the NebulaGraph Analytics cluster over SSH without passwords. Run the following commands on machine A: //Press Enter to execute the default option to generate the key. ssh-keygen -t rsa //After the public key file of machine A is installed to the user of the machine B-1, you can log into the machine B-1 from the machine A without passwords. ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <B_user>@<B_IP> In the same way, complete the SSH password-free configurations so that the user in machine A can log directly into machines B-2, B-3, etc. and all machines within the NebulaGraph Analytics cluster can connect directly to each other without passwords. Run eval $(ssh-agent) on the Dag Controller machine to start the ssh-agent, then run ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa to give the private key to the ssh-agent to manage. Note ssh-agent is a key manager that manages multiple keys and provides proxies for other programs that need to use SSH key pairs. Configure the username and port of the NebulaGraph Analytics in the file dag-ctrl-api.yaml , the file path is dag-ctrl/etc/dag-ctrl-api.yaml . If there are multiple machines, ensure that the usernames and ports are the same. # configuration name. Name: task-api Host: 0.0.0.0 # The IP address of Dag Controller.

Background \u00b6 NebulaGraph Explorer provides multiple components, including graph query and graph computing components. Users can combine these components based on the scheduling tool Dag Controller for free. For example, using the output of a graph query component as an input to a graph computing component. The whole process is a directed acyclic workflow. Instantiate the workflow when performing graph computing. The instantiated component is called task , and the instantiated workflow is called job . A job can consist of multiple tasks. The NebulaGraph Explorer sends the job to NebulaGraph Analytics for graph computing, and you can view the result in the job list. Features \u00b6 Add, view, modify, delete, compare, clone and rename workflows. A workflow supports one query component and multiple graph computing components. You can search for, add, configure, and rename component. View the lists, progresses, results and logs of the jobs, and rerun jobs. Search for workflows or jobs. Precautions \u00b6 The Workflow page can be displayed only when Workflow is enabled in . Additional deployment of the Dag Controller and the NebulaGraph Analytics is required to use a workflow. For details, see NebulaGraph Analytics and Deploy Explorer . The input to the graph query component can only be the nGQL. The results of a graph query component can be stored in the NFS by default and also in HDFS, which is convenient to be called by multiple algorithms. The input to the graph computing component can be the specified data in the NebulaGraph, NFS or HDFS, or can depend on the results of the graph query component. If an input depends on the results of the previous graph query component, the graph computing component must be fully connected to the graph query component, that is, the white output anchors of the previous graph query component are all connected to the white input anchors of the graph compute component. The parameters of some algorithms can also depend on the upstream components. The result of the graph computing components can be stored in the NebulaGraph, NFS or HDFS, but not all algorithm results are suitable to be stored in NebulaGraph.

Importer can read and import CSV file data from multiple data sources. Features \u00b6 Support multiple data sources, including local, S3, OSS, HDFS, FTP, and SFTP. Support importing data from CSV format files. A single file can contain multiple tags, multiple edge types or a mix of both. Support connecting to multiple Graph services simultaneously for importing and dynamic load balancing. Support reconnect or retry after failure. Support displaying statistics in multiple dimensions, including import time, import percentage, etc. Support for printing statistics in Console or logs. Advantage \u00b6 Lightweight and fast: no complex environment can be used, fast data import. Flexible filtering: You can flexibly filter CSV data through configuration files. Release note \u00b6 Release Prerequisites \u00b6 Before using NebulaGraph Importer, make sure: NebulaGraph service has been deployed. There are currently three deployment modes: Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose Install NebulaGraph with RPM or DEB package Install NebulaGraph by compiling the source code Schema is created in NebulaGraph, including space, Tag and Edge type, or set by parameter manager.hooks.before.statements . Steps \u00b6 Prepare the CSV file to be imported and configure the YAML file to use the tool to batch write data into NebulaGraph. Note For details about the YAML configuration file, see Configuration File Description at the end of topic. Download binary package and run \u00b6 Download the executable binary package . Note The file installation path based on the RPM/DEB package is /usr/bin/nebula-importer . Under the directory where the binary file is located, run the following command to start importing data. ./<binary_file_name> --config <yaml_config_file_path> Source code compile and run \u00b6 Compiling the source code requires deploying a Golang environment.

Enterpriseonly This feature is only for the enterprise edition NebulaGraph clusters on Kubernetes. Overview \u00b6 NebulaGraph BR (Enterprise Edition), short for BR-ent is a command line tool for data backup and recovery of NebulaGraph enterprise edition. NebulaGraph Operator utilizes the BR-ent tool to achieve data backup and recovery for NebulaGraph clusters on Kubernetes. When backing up data, NebulaGraph Operator creates a job to back up the data in the NebulaGraph cluster to the specified storage service. When restoring data, NebulaGraph Operator checks the specified backup NebulaGraph cluster for existence, and whether the access to remote storage is normally based on the information defined in the NebulaRestore resource object. It then creates a new cluster and restores the backup data to the new NebulaGraph cluster. For more information, see restore flowchart . Prerequisites \u00b6 To backup and restore data using NebulaGraph Operator, the following conditions must be met: Nebula Operator version >= 1.4.0. The enterprise edition NebulaGraph cluster deployed on Kubernetes is running. In the YAML file used to create the cluster, spec.enableBR is set to true. // Partial content of a sample cluster YAML file. apiVersion: apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1 kind: NebulaCluster metadata: name: nebula spec: enableBR: true // Set to true to enable the backup and restore function. ... Only storage services that use the S3 protocol (such as AWS S3, Minio, etc.) can be used to back up and restore data. Sufficient computing resources are available in the cluster to restore data. Backup \u00b6 Notes \u00b6 NebulaGraph Operator supports full and incremental backups. During data backup, DDL and DML statements in the specified graph space will be blocked. We recommend performing the operation during off-peak hours, such as from 2:00 am to 5:00 am. The cluster executing incremental backups and the cluster specified for the last backup must be the same, and the (storage bucket) path for the last backup must be the same. Ensure that the time between each incremental backup and the last backup is less than a wal_ttl . Specifying the backup data of a specified graph space is not supported. Before backing up data, you need to create a Secret to restore the credential for pulling the image of the BR-ent tool. kubectl - <nebula> create secret docker-registry <br-ent-secret> \\ --docker-server=REGISTRY_SERVER \\ --docker-username=REGISTRY_USERNAME \\ --docker-password=REGISTRY_PASSWORD \\ <nebula> : The namespace where the Secret is located. <br-ent-secret> : The name of the Secret. REGISTRY_SERVER : The address of the private image repository server from which the image is pulled, for example, reg.example-inc.com . REGISTRY_USERNAME : The username for logging in to the private image repository server. REGISTRY_PASSWORD : The password for logging in to the private image repository server. Full backup \u00b6 When backing up data to a storage service compatible with the S3 protocol, you need to create a backup job, which will back up the full NebulaGraph data to the specified storage location. Here is an example of the YAML file for a full backup job: apiVersion : batch/v1 kind : Job metadata : name : nebula-full-backup spec : parallelism : 1 ttlSecondsAfterFinished : 600 template : spec : restartPolicy : OnFailure imagePullSecrets : - name : br-ent-secret # The name of the Secret for pulling the image of the BR-ent tool. containers : - image : reg.vesoft-inc.com/cloud-dev/br-ent:v3.5.1 imagePullPolicy : Always name : backup command : - /bin/sh - -ecx - 'exec /usr/local/bin/br-ent backup full --meta nebula-metad-0.nebula-metad-headless.nebula.svc.cluster.local:9559 # The address of the Metad service. --storage s3://BUCKET # The storage location of the backup file. --s3.access_key ACCESS_KEY # The AccessKey for accessing the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. --s3.secret_key SECRET_KEY # The SecretKey for accessing the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. --s3.region REGION # The region of the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. --s3.endpoint https://s3.REGION.amazonaws.com' # The endpoint of the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. Incremental backup \u00b6 Except for the name of the job and the command specified in spec.template.spec.containers[0].command , the YAML file for incremental backup is the same as that for a full backup. Here is an example of the YAML file for incremental backup: apiVersion : batch/v1 kind : Job metadata : name : nebula-incr-backup spec : parallelism : 1 ttlSecondsAfterFinished : 60 template : spec : restartPolicy : OnFailure imagePullSecrets : - name : br-ent-secret containers : - image : reg.vesoft-inc.com/cloud-dev/br-ent:v3.5.1 imagePullPolicy : Always name : backup command : - /bin/sh - -ecx - 'exec /usr/local/bin/br-ent backup incr --meta nebula-metad-0.nebula-metad-headless.nebula.svc.cluster.local:9559 # The address of the Metad service. --storage s3://BUCKET # The storage location of the backup file. --s3.access_key ACCESS_KEY # The AccessKey for accessing the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. --s3.secret_key SECRET_KEY # The SecretKey for accessing the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. --s3.region REGION # The region of the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. --s3.endpoint https://s3.REGION.amazonaws.com' # The endpoint of the S3 protocol-compatible storage service. Parameter description \u00b6 The main parameters are described as follows: Parameter Default value Description spec.parallelism 1 The number of tasks executed in parallel. spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished 60 The time to keep task information after the task is completed. spec.template.spec.containers[0].image vesoft/br-ent:3.5.1 The image address of the NebulaGraph BR Enterprise Edition tool. spec.template.spec.containers[0].command - The command for backing up data to the storage service compatible with the S3 protocol. For descriptions of the options in the command, see Parametr description . For more settings of the job, see Kubernetes Jobs . After the YAML file for the backup job is set, run the following command to start the backup job: kubectl apply -f <backup_file_name>.yaml When the data backup succeeds, a backup file is generated in the specified storage location. For example, the backup file name is BACKUP_2023_02_12_10_04_16 . Encrypted backup \u00b6 If you enable mTLS authentication for the NebulaGraph cluster, you need to certify the BR-ent tool to access the NebulaGraph cluster. In the YAML file for the backup job, add volumes to store the client certificate files and the CA certificate files, and mount the certificate files to the container. Then add the --enable_ssl and --insecure_skip_verify options to the command for backing up data. Note Create Secrets to store the certificate files before creating the backup job, and make sure the Secrets are in the namespace where the backup job is located. For details, see Enable mTLS in NebulaGraph . The following provides an example of the YAML file for a full backup job with mTLS authentication enabled: apiVersion : batch/v1 kind : Job metadata : name : nebula-full-backup spec : parallelism : 1 ttlSecondsAfterFinished : 600 template : spec : restartPolicy : OnFailure imagePullSecrets : - name : nebula-image containers : - image : reg.vesoft-inc.com/cloud-dev/br-ent:v3.5.1 imagePullPolicy : Always name : backup command : - /bin/sh - -ecx - 'exec /usr/local/bin/br-ent backup full --meta META_ADDRESS:9559 --storage s3://BUCKET --s3.access_key ACCESS_KEY --s3.secret_key SECRET_KEY --s3.region REGION --s3.endpoint https://s3.REGION.amazonaws.com --enable_ssl # Enable mTLS authentication. --insecure_skip_verify' # Skip the verification of the server's certificate chain and hostname. volumeMounts : # Mount the certificate files. - mountPath : /usr/local/certs/client.crt # The path of the certificate content file.

Restore \u00b6 Notes \u00b6 After the data recovery is successful, a new cluster will be created and the old cluster will not be deleted by default. You can decide whether to delete the old cluster yourself. The name of the new cluster is automatically generated by the Operator. There will be a period of service unavailability during the data recovery process, so it is recommended to operate during a low period of business activity. Process \u00b6 When restoring data from a compatible S3 protocol service, you need to create a Secret to store the credentials for accessing the compatible S3 protocol service. Then create a resource object (NebulaRestore) for restoring the data, which will instruct the Operator to create a new NebulaGraph cluster based on the information defined in this resource object and restore the backup data to the newly created cluster. Here is an example YAML for restoring data based on the backup file BACKUP_2023_02_12_10_04_16 : apiVersion : v1 kind : Secret metadata : name : aws-s3-secret type : Opaque data : access-key : QVNJQVE0WFlxxx secret-key : ZFJ6OEdNcDdxenMwVGxxx --- apiVersion : apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1 kind : NebulaRestore metadata : name : restore1 spec : br : clusterName : nebula backupName : \"BACKUP_2023_02_12_10_04_16\" concurrency : 5 s3 : region : \"us-west-2\" bucket : \"nebula-br-test\" endpoint : \"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\" secretName : \"aws-s3-secret\" Parameter Description \u00b6 Secret Parameter Default Value Description metadata.name - The name of the Secret. type Opaque The type of the Secret.

Prerequisites \u00b6 Create a NebulaGraph cluster with NebulaGraph Operator on Kubernetes. For more information, see Deploy NebulaGraph clusters with Kubectl or Deploy NebulaGraph clusters with Helm . Connect to NebulaGraph databases from outside a NebulaGraph cluster via NodePort \u00b6 You can create a NodePort type Service to access internal cluster services from outside the cluster using any node IP and the exposed node port. You can also utilize load balancing services provided by cloud vendors (such as Azure, AWS, etc.) by setting the Service type to LoadBalancer . This allows external access to internal cluster services through the public IP and port of the load balancer provided by the cloud vendor. The Service of type NodePort forwards the front-end requests via the label selector spec.selector to Graphd pods with labels app.kubernetes.io/cluster: <cluster-name> and app.kubernetes.io/component: graphd . After creating a NebulaGraph cluster based on the example template , where spec.graphd.service.type=NodePort , the NebulaGraph Operator will automatically create a NodePort type Service named <cluster-name>-graphd-svc in the same namespace. You can directly connect to the NebulaGraph database through any node IP and the exposed node port (see step 4 below). You can also create a custom Service according to your needs. Steps: Create a YAML file named graphd-nodeport-service.yaml . The file contents are as follows: apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : labels : app.kubernetes.io/cluster : nebula app.kubernetes.io/component : graphd app.kubernetes.io/managed-by : nebula-operator app.kubernetes.io/name : nebula-graph name : nebula-graphd-svc-nodeport namespace : default spec : externalTrafficPolicy : Local ports : - name : thrift port : 9669 protocol : TCP targetPort : 9669 - name : http port : 19669 protocol : TCP targetPort : 19669 selector : app.kubernetes.io/cluster : nebula app.kubernetes.io/component : graphd app.kubernetes.io/managed-by : nebula-operator app.kubernetes.io/name : nebula-graph type : NodePort # Set the type to NodePort.

Before enabling authentication, you can use any existing username. The default username is root. -p : The password of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the password. Connect to NebulaGraph databases from within a NebulaGraph cluster \u00b6 You can also create a ClusterIP type Service to provide an access point to the NebulaGraph database for other Pods within the cluster. By using the Service's IP and the Graph service's port number (9669), you can connect to the NebulaGraph database. For more information, see ClusterIP . Create a file named graphd-clusterip-service.yaml . The file contents are as follows: apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : labels : app.kubernetes.io/cluster : nebula app.kubernetes.io/component : graphd app.kubernetes.io/managed-by : nebula-operator app.kubernetes.io/name : nebula-graph name : nebula-graphd-svc namespace : default spec : externalTrafficPolicy : Local ports : - name : thrift port : 9669 protocol : TCP targetPort : 9669 - name : http port : 19669 protocol : TCP targetPort : 19669 selector : app.kubernetes.io/cluster : nebula app.kubernetes.io/component : graphd app.kubernetes.io/managed-by : nebula-operator app.kubernetes.io/name : nebula-graph type : ClusterIP # Set the type to ClusterIP.

Connect to NebulaGraph databases from outside a NebulaGraph cluster via Ingress \u00b6 When dealing with multiple pods in a cluster, managing services for each pod separately is not a good practice. Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that provides a unified entry point for accessing multiple services. Ingress can be used to expose multiple services under a single IP address. Nginx Ingress is an implementation of Kubernetes Ingress. Nginx Ingress watches the Ingress resource of a Kubernetes cluster and generates the Ingress rules into Nginx configurations that enable Nginx to forward 7 layers of traffic. You can use Nginx Ingress to connect to a NebulaGraph cluster from outside the cluster using a combination of the host network and DaemonSet pattern. Due to the use of HostNetwork , Nginx Ingress pods may be scheduled on the same node (port conflicts will occur when multiple pods try to listen on the same port on the same node). To avoid this situation, Nginx Ingress is deployed on these nodes in DaemonSet mode (ensuring that a pod replica runs on each node in the cluster). You first need to select some nodes and label them for the specific deployment of Nginx Ingress. Ingress does not support TCP or UDP services. For this reason, the nginx-ingress-controller pod uses the flags --tcp-services-configmap and --udp-services-configmap to point to an existing ConfigMap where the key refers to the external port to be used and the value refers to the format of the service to be exposed. The format of the value is <namespace/service_name>:<service_port> . For example, the configurations of the ConfigMap named as tcp-services is as follows: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : tcp-services namespace : nginx-ingress data : # update 9769 : \"default/nebula-graphd-svc:9669\" Steps are as follows. Create a file named nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml . Click on nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml to view the complete content of the example YAML file. Note The resource objects in the YAML file above use the namespace nginx-ingress . You can run kubectl create namespace nginx-ingress to create this namespace, or you can customize the namespace. Label a node where the DaemonSet named nginx-ingress-controller in the above YAML file (The node used in this example is named worker2 with an IP of 192.168.8.160 ) runs. kubectl label node worker2 nginx-ingress = true Run the following command to enable Nginx Ingress in the cluster you created. kubectl create -f nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml Output: configmap/nginx-ingress-controller created configmap/tcp-services created serviceaccount/nginx-ingress created serviceaccount/nginx-ingress-backend created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created service/nginx-ingress-controller-metrics created service/nginx-ingress-default-backend created service/nginx-ingress-proxy-tcp created daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller created Since the network type that is configured in Nginx Ingress is hostNetwork , after successfully deploying Nginx Ingress, with the IP ( 192.168.8.160 ) of the node where Nginx Ingress is deployed and with the external port ( 9769 ) you define, you can access NebulaGraph. Use the IP address and the port configured in the preceding steps. You can connect to NebulaGraph with NebulaGraph Console. kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:v3.5.0 --restart = Never -- <nebula_console_name> -addr <host_ip> -port <external_port> -u <username> -p <password> Output: kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:v3.5.0 --restart = Never -- nebula-console -addr 192 .168.8.160 -port 9769 -u root -p vesoft --image : The image for the tool NebulaGraph Console used to connect to NebulaGraph databases. <nebula-console> The custom Pod name.

Is cluster stability guaranteed if using local storage? \u00b6 There is no guarantee. Using local storage means that the Pod is bound to a specific node, and NebulaGraph Operator does not currently support failover in the event of a failure of the bound node. How to ensure the stability of a cluster when scaling the cluster? \u00b6 It is suggested to back up data in advance so that you can roll back data in case of failure. Is the replica in the Operator docs the same as the replica in the NebulaGraph core docs? \u00b6 They are different concepts. A replica in the Operator docs indicates a pod replica in K8s, while a replica in the core docs is a replica of a NebulaGraph storage partition. How to view the logs of each service in the NebulaGraph cluster? \u00b6 The logs for the NebulaGraph cluster are not gathered in the K8s cluster, which also means that they cannot be retrieved through the kubectl logs command. To obtain the logs of each cluster service, you need to access the container and view the log files that are stored inside. This is the only option available for users to get the service logs individually in the NebulaGraph cluster. Steps to view the logs of each service in the NebulaGraph cluster: # To view the name of the pod where the container you want to access is located. # Replace <cluster-name> with the name of the cluster. kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster = <cluster-name> # To access the container within the pod, such as the nebula-graphd-0 container. kubectl exec -it nebula-graphd-0 -- /bin/bash # To go to /usr/local/nebula/logs directory to view the logs. cd /usr/local/nebula/logs How to resolve the host not found:nebula-<metad|storaged|graphd>-0.nebula.<metad|storaged|graphd>-headless.default.svc.cluster.local error? \u00b6 This error is generally caused by a DNS resolution failure, and you need to check whether the cluster domain has been modified. If the cluster domain has been modified, you need to modify the kubernetesClusterDomain field in the NebulaGraph Operator configuration file accordingly. The steps for modifying the Operator configuration file are as follows: View the Operator configuration file.

TLS, which was formerly called SSL, authenticates the server in a client-server connection and encrypts communications between client and server so that external parties cannot spy on the communications. Its working principle is mainly to protect data transmitted over the network by using encryption algorithms to prevent data interception or tampering during transmission. During the TLS connection establishment process, the server sends a digital certificate containing a public key and some identity information to the client. This certificate is issued by a trusted third-party Certification Authority (CA). The client verifies this digital certificate to confirm the identity of the server. In the NebulaGraph environment running in Kubernetes, mutual TLS (mTLS) is used to encrypt the communication between the client and server by default, which means both the client and server need to verify their identities. This article explains how to enable mTLS encryption in NebulaGraph running in K8s. Prerequisites \u00b6 NebulaGraph Operator has been installed. A NebulaGraph cluster has been created. For details, see Create a NebulaGraph cluster with kubectl or Create a NebulaGraph cluster with Helm . Certificates and their corresponding private keys have been generated for the client and server, and the CA certificate has been generated. For details, see Generate Certificates Manually . Note In the cluster created using Operator, the client and server use the same CA root certificate by default. Create a TLS-type Secret \u00b6 In a K8s cluster, you can create Secrets to store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and TLS certificates. In NebulaGraph, you can create a Secret to store TLS certificates and private keys. When creating a Secret, the type tls should be specified. A tls Secret is used to store TLS certificates. For example, to create a Secret for storing server certificates and private keys: kubectl create secret tls <server-cert> --key = <path/to/tls.key> --cert = <path/to/tls.cert> --namespace = <namespace> <server-cert> : The name of the Secret storing the server certificate and private key. <path/to/tls.key> : The path to the server private key file. <path/to/tls.cert> : The path to the server certificate file. <namespace> : The namespace where the Secret is located. If --namespace is not specified, it defaults to the default namespace. You can follow the above steps to create Secrets for the client certificate and private key, and the CA certificate. To view the created Secrets: kubectl get secret --namespace = <namespace> Configure certifications \u00b6 Operator provides the sslCerts field to specify the encrypted certificates. The sslCerts field contains three subfields: serverSecret , clientSecret , and caSecret . These three fields are used to specify the Secret names of the NebulaGraph server certificate, client certificate, and CA certificate, respectively. When you specify these three fields, Operator reads the certificate content from the corresponding Secret and mounts it into the cluster's Pod. sslCerts : serverSecret : \"server-cert\" # The name of the server certificate Secret. serverCert : \"\" # The key name of the certificate in the server certificate Secret, default is tls.crt. serverKey : \"\" # The key name of the private key in the server certificate Secret, default is tls.key. clientSecret : \"client-cert\" # The name of the client certificate Secret. clientCert : \"\" # The key name of the certificate in the client certificate Secret, default is tls.crt. clientKey : \"\" # The key name of the private key in the client certificate Secret, default is tls.key. caSecret : \"ca-cert\" # The name of the CA certificate Secret. caCert : \"\" # The key name of the certificate in the CA certificate Secret, default is ca.crt. The serverCert and serverKey , clientCert and clientKey , and caCert are used to specify the key names of the certificate and private key of the server Secret, the key names of the certificate and private key of the client Secret, and the key name of the CA Secret certificate. If you do not customize these field values, Operator defaults serverCert and clientCert to tls.crt , serverKey and clientKey to tls.key , and caCert to ca.crt . However, in the K8s cluster, the TLS type Secret uses tls.crt and tls.key as the default key names for the certificate and private key. Therefore, after creating the NebulaGraph cluster, you need to manually change the caCert field from ca.crt to tls.crt in the cluster configuration, so that the Operator can correctly read the content of the CA certificate. Before you customize these field values, you need to specify the key names of the certificate and private key in the Secret when creating it. For how to create a Secret with the key name specified, run the kubectl create secret generic -h command for help. You can use the insecureSkipVerify field to decide whether the client will verify the server's certificate chain and hostname. In production environments, it is recommended to set this to false to ensure the security of communication. If set to true , the client will not verify the server's certificate chain and hostname. sslCerts : # Determines whether the client needs to verify the server's certificate chain and hostname when establishing an SSL connection. insecureSkipVerify : false When the certificates are approaching expiration, they can be automatically updated by installing cert-manager . NebulaGraph will monitor changes to the certificate directory files, and once a change is detected, it will load the new certificate content into memory. Encryption strategies \u00b6 NebulaGraph offers three encryption strategies that you can choose and configure according to your needs. Encryption of client-graph and all inter-service communications If you want to encrypt all data transmission between the client, Graph service, Meta service, and Storage service, you need to add the enable_ssl = true field to each service. Here is an example configuration: apiVersion : apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1 kind : NebulaCluster metadata : name : nebula namespace : default spec : sslCerts : serverSecret : \"server-cert\" # The Secret name of the server certificate and private key. clientSecret : \"client-cert\" # The Secret name of the client certificate and private key. caSecret : \"ca-cert\" # The Secret name of the CA certificate. graphd : config : enable_ssl : \"true\" metad : config : enable_ssl : \"true\" storaged : config : enable_ssl : \"true\" Encryption of only Graph service communication If the K8s cluster is deployed in the same data center and only the port of the Graph service is exposed externally, you can choose to encrypt only data transmission between the client and the Graph service. In this case, other services can communicate internally without encryption. Just add the enable_graph_ssl = true field to the Graph service. Here is an example configuration: apiVersion : apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1 kind : NebulaCluster metadata : name : nebula namespace : default spec : sslCerts : serverSecret : \"server-cert\" caSecret : \"ca-cert\" graphd : config : enable_graph_ssl : \"true\" Note Because Operator doesn't need to call the Graph service through an interface, it's not necessary to set clientSecret in sslCerts . Encryption of only Meta service communication If you need to transmit confidential information to the Meta service, you can choose to encrypt data transmission related to the Meta service. In this case, you need to add the enable_meta_ssl = true configuration to each component. Here is an example configuration: apiVersion : apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1 kind : NebulaCluster metadata : name : nebula namespace : default spec : sslCerts : serverSecret : \"server-cert\" clientSecret : \"client-cert\" caSecret : \"ca-cert\" graphd : config : enable_meta_ssl : \"true\" metad : config : enable_meta_ssl : \"true\" storaged : config : enable_meta_ssl : \"true\" After setting up the encryption policy, when an external client needs to connect to the Graph service with mutual TLS, you still need to set the relevant TLS parameters according to the different clients. See the Use NebulaGraph Console to connect to Graph service section below for examples. Steps \u00b6 Use the pre-generated server and client certificates and private keys, and the CA certificate to create a Secret for each. kubectl create secret tls <client/server/ca-cert-secret> --key=<client/server/ca.key> --cert=<client/server/ca.crt> tls : Indicates that the type of secret being created is TLS, which is used to store TLS certificates. <client/server/ca-cert-secret> : Specifies the name of the new secret being created, which can be customized. --key=<client/server/ca.key> : Specifies the path to the private key file of the TLS certificate to be stored in the secret. --cert=<client/server/ca.crt> : Specifies the path to the public key certificate file of the TLS certificate to be stored in the secret. Add server certificate, client certificate, CA certificate configuration, and encryption policy configuration in the corresponding cluster instance YAML file. For details, see Encryption strategies . For example, add encryption configuration for transmission data between client, Graph service, Meta service, and Storage service. apiVersion : apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1 kind : NebulaCluster metadata : name : nebula namespace : default spec : sslCerts : serverSecret : \"server-cert\" // The name of the server Certificate Secret. clientSecret : \"client-cert\" // The name of the client Certificate Secret. caSecret : \"ca-cert\" // The name of the CA Certificate Secret. graphd : config : enable_ssl : \"true\" metad : config : enable_ssl : \"true\" storaged : config : enable_ssl : \"true\" Use kubectl apply -f to apply the file to the Kubernetes cluster. Verify that the values of serverCert , serverKey , clientCert , clientKey , caCert under the sslCerts field in the cluster configuration match the key names of the certificates and private keys stored in the created Secret. # Check the key names of the certificate and private key stored in the Secret. For example, check the key name of the CA certificate stored in the Secret. kubectl get secret ca-cert -o yaml # Check the cluster configuration file. kubectl get nebulacluster nebula -o yaml Example output: ... spec: sslCerts: serverSecret: server-cert serverCert: tls.crt serverKey: tls.key clientSecret: client-cert clientCert: tls.crt clientKey: tls.key caSecret: ca-cert caCert: ca.crt ... If the key names of the certificates and private keys stored in the Secret are different from the values of serverCert , serverKey , clientCert , clientKey , caCert under the sslCerts field in the cluster configuration, you need to execute kubectl edit nebulacluster <cluster_name> to manually modify the cluster configuration file. In the example output, the key name of the CA certificate in the TLS-type Secret is tls.crt , so you need to change the value of caCert from ca.crt to tls.crt . Use NebulaGraph Console to connect to the Graph service and establish a secure TLS connection. Example: kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:v3.5.0 --restart=Never -- nebula-console -addr 10.98.xxx.xx -port 9669 -u root -p nebula -enable_ssl -ssl_root_ca_path /path/to/cert/root.crt -ssl_cert_path /path/to/cert/client.crt -ssl_private_key_path /path/to/cert/client.key -enable_ssl : Use mTLS when connecting to NebulaGraph. -ssl_root_ca_path : Specify the storage path of the CA root certificate. -ssl_cert_path : Specify the storage path of the TLS public key certificate. -ssl_private_key_path : Specify the storage path of the TLS private key.

It helps you quickly get started with NebulaGraph. On the Import page, you can operate batch import of vertex and edge data with clicks, and view a real-time import log. On the Console page, you can run nGQL statements and read the results in a human-friendly way. Scenarios \u00b6 You can use Studio in one of these scenarios: You have a dataset, and you want to explore and analyze data in a visualized way. You can use Docker Compose to deploy NebulaGraph and then use Studio to explore or analyze data in a visualized way. You are a beginner of nGQL (NebulaGraph Query Language) and you prefer to use a GUI rather than a command-line interface (CLI) to learn the language. Authentication \u00b6 Authentication is not enabled in NebulaGraph by default. Users can log into Studio with the root account and any password. When NebulaGraph enables authentication, users can only sign into Studio with the specified account. For more information, see Authentication .

It applies to scenarios such as disaster recovery and load balancing, and helps reduce the risk of data loss and enhance data security. Enterpriseonly This feature applies to the Enterprise Edition only. Synchronization workflow \u00b6 The synchronization works as follows: The primary cluster sends any data written into it to the Meta listener or the Storage listener in the form of WALs or snapshots. The listener sends the data to the drainer in the form of WALs. The drainer sends the data to the partitions of the secondary cluster through the Meta client or the Storage client. Applicable Scenarios \u00b6 Remote disaster recovery: Data synchronization enables cross-data-center or cross-city disaster recovery. Data migration: The migration can be implemented by synchronizing data and then switching cluster roles, without stopping the service. Read/Write splitting: Enable only writing on the primary cluster and only reading on the secondary cluster to lower the system load, and improve stability and usability. Precautions \u00b6 Make sure that the primary and secondary clusters are deployed in the same NebulaGraph version. Otherwise, the synchronization will fail. The synchronization is based on graph spaces, i.e., from one graph space in the primary cluster to another in the secondary cluster. About the synchronization topology, NebulaGraph: Supports synchronizing from one primary cluster to one secondary cluster, but not multiple primary clusters to one secondary cluster. Supports chained synchronization but not synchronization from one primary cluster to multiple secondary clusters directly. An example of chained synchronization is from cluster A to cluster B, and then cluster B to cluster C. The synchronization is implemented asynchronously, but with low latency. The Meta listener listens to the Meta Service and the Storage listener listens to the Storage Service. Do not mix them up. One graph space can have one Meta listener and one to multiple Storage listeners. These listeners can work with one to multiple drainers: One listener with one drainer. Multiple listeners with one drainer. Multiple listeners with multiple drainers. The machines where the listeners and drainers run must have enough disk space to store the WAL or snapshot files. If the target graph space in the secondary cluster has data before the synchronization starts, data conflicts or inconsistencies may happen during the synchronization. It is recommended to keep the target graph space empty. It is recommended to use the NebulaGraph root user with the God privileges to perform the cluster data synchronization. The required user roles for each synchronization command are different. For details, see the Role permission requirements section at the end of this topic. During the synchronization, do not perform data recovery (backup recovery and snapshot recovery) operations on the primary cluster at the same time. Otherwise, the synchronization will fail. Prerequisites \u00b6 Prepare at least two machines to deploy the primary and secondary clusters, the listeners, and the drainer. The listener and drainer can be deployed in a standalone way, or on the machines hosting the primary and secondary clusters. The latter way can increase the machine load and decrease the service performance. Test environment \u00b6 The test environment for the operation example in this topic is as follows: The primary cluster runs on the machine with the IP address 192.168.10.101. The cluster has one nebula-graphd process, one nebula-metad process, and one nebula-storaged process. The secondary cluster runs on the machine with the IP address 192.168.10.102. The cluster has one nebula-graphd process, one nebula-metad process, and one nebula-storaged process. Note The primary and secondary clusters can have different cluster specifications, such as different numbers of machines, service processes, and data partitions. The processes for the Meta and Storage listeners run on the machine with the IP address 192.168.10.103. The process for the drainer runs on the machine with the IP address 192.168.10.104. Steps \u00b6 Step 1: Set up the clusters, listeners, and drainer \u00b6 Install NebulaGraph on all the machines. For installation instructions, see Install NebulaGraph . Modify the configuration files on all the machines. Note For newly installed services, remove the suffix .default or .production of a configuration template file in the conf directory to make it take effect. In the Meta service configuration file ( nebula-metad.conf ) of NebulaGraph, set the value of license_manager_url to the host IP and port number 9119 where the license management tool is located, e.g. 192.168.8.100:9119 . On the primary and secondary cluster machines, modify nebula-graphd.conf , nebula-metad.conf , and nebula-storaged.conf . In all three files, set real IP addresses for local_ip instead of 127.0.0.1 , and set the IP addresses and ports for their own nebula-metad processes as the meta_server_addrs values. In nebula-graphd.conf , set enable_authorize=true . On the primary cluster, set --snapshot_send_files=false in both the nebula-storaged.conf file and the nebula-metad.conf file. On the Meta listener machine, modify nebula-metad-listener.conf . Set the IP addresses and ports of the primary cluster's nebula-metad processes for meta_server_addrs , and those of the listener process for meta_sync_listener . On the Storage listener machine, modify nebula-storaged-listener.conf . Set the IP addresses and ports of the primary cluster's nebula-metad processes for meta_server_addrs . On the drainer machine, modify nebula-drainerd.conf . Set the IP addresses and ports of the secondary cluster's nebula-metad processes for meta_server_addrs . For more information about the configurations, see Configurations . Go to the NebulaGraph installation directories on the machines and start the needed services.

To stop data synchronization, run the STOP SYNC command. The listener stops sending data to the drainer. To restart data synchronization, run the RESTART SYNC command. The listener sends the data accumulated during the period when the synchronization is stopped to the drainer. If the WALs are lost, the listener pulls the snapshot from the primary cluster and synchronizes data again. View the status of inter-cluster data synchronization \u00b6 When data is written to the primary cluster, you can check the status of inter-cluster data synchronization and tell whether data synchronization is normal. Check the status of synchronized data in the primary cluster \u00b6 You can execute the SHOW SYNC STATUS command in the primary cluster to view the status of the data sent from the primary cluster to the secondary cluster. SHOW SYNC STATUS gets the information of data synchronization status between clusters in real-time, and sends synchronized data to the secondary cluster only when the primary cluster has written successfully. Examples are as follows. // Write data to the primary cluster. nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) VALUES \"player102\":(\"LaMarcus Aldridge\", 33); nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) VALUES \"player102\":(\"LaMarcus Aldridge\", 33); nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) VALUES \"player103\":(\"Rudy Gay\", 32); nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) VALUES \"player104\":(\"Marco Belinelli\", 32); // Check the status of data synchronization in the current cluster (the returned result indicates that data is being sent to the secondary cluster). nebula> SHOW SYNC STATUS; +--------+-------------+-----------+--------------+ | PartId | Sync Status | LogId Lag | Time Latency | +--------+-------------+-----------+--------------+ | 0 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 1 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 2 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 3 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 4 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 5 | \"ONLINE\" | 1 | 46242122 | | 6 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 7 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 8 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 9 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 10 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 11 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 12 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 13 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 14 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 15 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | +--------+-------------+-----------+--------------+ // Check the status of data synchronization in the current cluster again (the returned result indicates that the data is fully synchronized to the secondary cluster and there is no data to be synchronized). nebula> SHOW SYNC STATUS; +--------+-------------+-----------+--------------+ | PartId | Sync Status | LogId Lag | Time Latency | +--------+-------------+-----------+--------------+ | 0 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 1 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 2 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 3 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 4 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 5 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 6 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 7 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 8 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 9 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 10 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 11 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 12 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 13 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 14 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | | 15 | \"ONLINE\" | 0 | 0 | +--------+-------------+-----------+--------------+ After executing the SHOW SYNC STATUS command, the parameters in the returned result are described as follows. Parameter Description PartId The partition ID in the specified graph space in the primary cluster. The Meta data to be synchronized by Meta listener is located in the partition 0 . The Storage data to be synchronized by Storage listener is located in other partitions. Sync Status Indicates the status of the listener service. When the listener is ONLINE , it continuously sends data to the drainer service. When the listener is OFFLINE , it stops sending data to the drainer. LogId Lag Indicates the difference between Log IDs, that is how many logs are still sent to the secondary cluster from the corresponding partition of the primary cluster. The value 0 indicates that there are no logs to be sent in the corresponding partition of the primary cluster. Time Latency The difference between the timestamp in the WAL of the last log to be sent and the timestamp in the WAL of the last log that has been sent in the corresponding partition of the primary cluster. The value 0 indicates that data has been sent to the secondary cluster. Unit: Millisecond.

The value 0 indicates that drainer partition data has been sent to metaClient / storageClient . Unit: Millisecond. Switch between primary and secondary clusters \u00b6 To migrate data or implement disaster recovery, manually switch between the primary and secondary clusters. Note Before the switching, set up a listener for the new primary cluster, and a drainer for the new secondary cluster. In the following example, the listener has IP address 192.168.10.105 and drainer 192.168.10.106. Log into the old primary cluster and set the working graph space as read-only to avoid data inconsistency. nebula> USE basketballplayer; nebula> SET VARIABLES read_only=true; Check whether the data in the old primary cluster has been synchronized to the old secondary cluster. Make sure the data in the old primary cluster has been synchronized to the old secondary cluster. In the old primary cluster, view the status of the data sent from the old primary cluster to the old secondary cluster. nebula> SHOW SYNC STATUS; Log into the old secondary cluster and then view the status of synchronizing data to the Meta and Storage services. nebula> USE replication_basketballplayer; nebula> SHOW DRAINER SYNC STATUS; When the values of LogId Lag and Time Latency in the returned results in both old primary and secondary clusters are 0 , the data synchronization is complete. In the old secondary cluster, disable read-only for the working graph space. nebula> SET VARIABLES read_only=false; Note If there is business data to be written, you can now write the business data to the old secondary cluster (the new primary cluster). In the old secondary cluster, remove the old drainer service. nebula> REMOVE DRAINER; Log into the old primary cluster, disable read-only, sign out the drainer, and remove the listener. nebula> USE basketballplayer; // Disable read-only for the working graph space, otherwise adding drainer fails. nebula> SET VARIABLES read_only=false; nebula> SIGN OUT DRAINER SERVICE; nebula> REMOVE LISTENER SYNC; In the old primary cluster, change the old primary cluster to the new secondary cluster by adding the new drainer service and setting the working graph space as read-only. Note Ensure that the new drainer service is deployed and started for the new secondary cluster. nebula> ADD DRAINER 192.168.10.106:9889; nebula> SET VARIABLES read_only=true; Log into the old secondary cluster and change the old secondary cluster to the new primary cluster.

Role permission requirements \u00b6 The required user roles for each synchronization command are different. The required roles for each command are as follows (A check mark indicates that the role has the permission). Command God Admin DBA User Guest SIGN IN / SIGN OUT DRAINER SERVICE \u221a ADD / REMOVE LISTENER SYNC \u221a \u221a \u221a SHOW DRAINER CLIENTS \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a SHOW LISTENER SYNC \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a ADD / REMOVE DRAINER \u221a \u221a \u221a SET VARIABLES read_only \u221a SHOW DRAINERS \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a FAQ \u00b6 Can the pre-existent data in the primary cluster be synchronized to the secondary cluster? \u00b6 Yes. After receiving the WAL from the listener, if the drainer finds that the data to be updated does not exist in the secondary cluster, it starts the synchronization of the complete data set. Will the pre-existent data in the secondary cluster affect the synchronization? \u00b6 If the pre-existent data in the secondary cluster is a subset of the data in the primary cluster, the data in the primary and secondary clusters will eventually become consistent through synchronization. If there is any pre-existent data (not a subset of the data in the primary cluster) in the secondary cluster before the synchronization, the data may be lost after the synchronization. It is recommended to use a secondary cluster without data for synchronization. Will the pre-existent schema information in the secondary cluster affect the synchronization? \u00b6 The pre-existent schema information must not conflict with the schema of the primary cluster. Otherwise, it will be overwritten, and related data in the secondary cluster might become invalid. Should the number of machines, replicas, and partitions in the primary and secondary clusters be the same? \u00b6 No. The synchronization is based on graph spaces, not other elements such as partitions and replicas. The primary and secondary clusters do not need to have the exact specifications. Does altering the schema in the primary cluster affect the synchronization? \u00b6 Altering the schema may increase the synchronization latency. The schema data is synchronized through the Meta listener, while the vertex/edge data is through the Storage listener. When synchronizing the vertex/edge data, the system checks the schema version of the data. If the system finds that the version number of the schema is greater than that in the secondary cluster, it pauses the vertex/edge data update, and updates the schema data first. How to deal with synchronization failures? \u00b6 Fix the problems in the cluster, and then the synchronization will be automatically restored. If problems have happened in the primary cluster, the synchronization continues when the problems are fixed and the primary cluster restarts. If problems have happened in the secondary cluster, listeners, or drainers, when the problems are fixed, the services that had the problems will receive the WALs accumulated from its upstream and the synchronization will continue working. If the faulty machine is replaced with a new one, all the data of the synchronization services on the faulty machine must be copied to the new machine. Otherwise, the synchronization of the complete data set will start automatically. How to check the data synchronization status and progress? \u00b6 You can run SHOW SYNC STATUS to check the status of the data sent by the primary cluster and run SHOW DRAINER SYNC STATUS to check the status of the data received by the secondary cluster. If all the data is sent successfully from the primary cluster and all the data is received successfully by the secondary cluster, the data synchronization is completed. My WAL log files has expired and will it affect the cluster synchronization? \u00b6 Expired WAL files (beyond the time set by --wal-ttl ) will cause unsynchronization of cluster data. You can manually add --snapshot_send_files=false to the configuration files of the Meta and Storage services to synchronize data. After updating the configuration files, you need to restart the services.

Otherwise, the synchronization will fail. The synchronization is based on graph spaces, i.e., from one graph space in the primary cluster to another in the secondary cluster. About the synchronization topology, NebulaGraph: Supports synchronizing from one primary cluster to one secondary cluster, but not multiple primary clusters to one secondary cluster. Supports chained synchronization but not synchronization from one primary cluster to multiple secondary clusters directly. An example of chained synchronization is from cluster A to cluster B, and then cluster B to cluster C. The synchronization is implemented asynchronously, but with low latency. The Meta listener listens to the Meta Service and the Storage listener listens to the Storage Service. Do not mix them up. One graph space can have one Meta listener and one to multiple Storage listeners. These listeners can work with one to multiple drainers: One listener with one drainer. Multiple listeners with one drainer. Multiple listeners with multiple drainers. The machines where the listeners and drainers run must have enough disk space to store the WAL or snapshot files. If the target graph space in the secondary cluster has data before the synchronization starts, data conflicts or inconsistencies may happen during the synchronization. It is recommended to keep the target graph space empty. It is recommended to use the NebulaGraph root user with the God privileges to perform the cluster data synchronization. The required user roles for each synchronization command are different. For details, see the Role permission requirements section at the end of this topic.

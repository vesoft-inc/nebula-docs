# Query graph data

When data is imported, you can use **Console** or **Explore** to query graph data.

For example, if you want to query the properties of the course named _History of Chinese Women Through Time_, you can perform these optional operations:

* On the **Console** tab: Run `FETCH PROP ON * hash("History of Chinese Women Through Time");`. The result window shows all the property information of this vertex. When the result returns, click the **Open in Explore** button and then you can view the vertex information in a visualized way.

* On the **Explore** tab: Click the **Start with Vertices** button. In the dialog box, enter **"History of Chinese Women Through Time"**, choose **Hash** to pre-process the VID, and then click the **Add** button. On the board, you can see the vertex. Move your mouse pointer on the vertex to see the vertex details, as shown in the preceding figure.

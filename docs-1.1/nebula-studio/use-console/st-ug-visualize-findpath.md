# View subgraphs

With the **View Subgraphs** function, you can run a `FIND SHORTEST | ALL PATH` statement on the **Console** page to retrieve all the paths or the shortest path between the specified vertices and then view the result on the **Explore** page.

For more information about `FIND SHORTEST | ALL PATH`, see [nGQL User Guide](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/2.query-language/4.statement-syntax/4.graph-algorithms/find-path-syntax/ "Click to go to Nebula Graph website").

## Studio version

Studio of v1.2.1-beta or later versions supports this function. To update the version, run this command.

```bash
$ docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

## Prerequisites

To use the **View Subgraphs** function, you must do a check of these:

- The version of Studio is v1.2.1-beta or later.
- Studio is connected to Nebula Graph.
- A dataset exists in the database. In the example of this article, the **mooc_actions** dataset is used. For more information, see [Import data](../quick-start/st-ug-import-data.md).

## Procedure

To query the paths on the **Console** page and then view them on the **Explore** page, follow these steps:

1. In the navigation bar, click the **Console** tab.
2. In the **Current Graph Space** dropdown list, choose a graph space name. In this example, **mooc_actions** is chosen.
3. In the input box, enter a `FIND SHORTEST PATH` or `FIND ALL PATH` statement and click **Run** ![Icon of Run](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-008.png "Run").

   Here is an nGQL statement example.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> FIND ALL PATH FROM 1,2,4,6,42 to hash("History of Ecology"),hash("Neurobiology") OVER action; -- For the mooc_actions dataset, the VIDs of the course vertices are generated by the hash("<courseName>") function.
    ```

    The queried result gives all the paths from the specified user vertices to the course vertices, as shown in this figure.

    ![The result window shows the queried paths](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-049.png "The queried PATHs")

4. Click the **View Subgraphs** button.
5. (Optional) If some data exists on the board of **Explore**, choose a method to insert data:

    - **Incremental Insertion**: Click this button to add the result to the existing data on the board.
    - **Insert After Clear**: Click this button to clear the existing data from the board and then add the data to the board.

When the data is inserted, you can view the visualized representation of the paths.

## Next to do

On the **Explore** page, you can expand the graph to explore and analyze graph data.

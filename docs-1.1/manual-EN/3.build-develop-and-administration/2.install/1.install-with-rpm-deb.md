# Nebula Graph Installation with rpm/deb Package

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of installing **Nebula Graph** with `rpm/deb` packages.

## Prerequisites

See [Operating Configuration Requirements Doc](../3.configurations/0.system-requirement.md).

## Installing Nebula Graph

To install **Nebula Graph** with a `rpm/deb` package, you must complete the following steps:

1. Download packages.

   * Method one: Download via OSS.

    1. Obtaining the release version information. The URL format is as follows:

    ```text
     * Centos 6: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/${release_version}/nebula-${release_version}.el6-5.x86_64.rpm

     * Centos 7: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/${release_version}/nebula-${release_version}.el7-5.x86_64.rpm

     * Ubuntu 1604: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/${release_version}/nebula-${release_version}.ubuntu1604.amd64.deb

     * Ubuntu 1804: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/${release_version}/nebula-${release_version}.ubuntu1804.amd64.deb
    ```

    The `${release_version}` in the link is the release version information. For example, use the follow command to download the {{ nebula.release }} Centos 7 package.

    ```bash
    $ wget https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/{{ nebula.release }}/nebula-{{ nebula.release }}.el7-5.x86_64.rpm
    ```

     b. Obtaining the nightly (latest) version. The URL format is as follows:

    ```text
     * Centos 6: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/nightly/${date}/nebula-${date}-nightly.el6-5.x86_64.rpm

     * Centos 7: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/nightly/${date}/nebula-${date}-nightly.el7-5.x86_64.rpm

     * Ubuntu 1604: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/nightly/${date}/nebula-${date}-nightly.ubuntu1604.amd64.deb

     * Ubuntu 1804: https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/nightly/${date}/nebula-${date}-nightly.ubuntu1804.amd64.deb
    ```

    The `${date}` in the link specifies the date.  For example, use the follow command to download the `2020-4-1` `Centos 7.5` package.

    ```bash
    $ wget https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.io/package/nightly/2020.04.01/nebula-2020.04.01-nightly.el7-5.x86_64.rpm
    ```

2. Install **Nebula Graph**.

* For a `rpm` file, install **Nebula Graph** with the following command:

```bash
sudo rpm -ivh nebula-2019.12.23-nightly.el6-5.x86_64.rpm
```

* For a `deb` file, install **Nebula Graph** with the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i nebula-2019.12.23-nightly.ubuntu1604.amd64.deb
```

* Install **Nebula Graph** to your customized directory with the following command:

```bash
rpm -ivh --prefix=${your_dir} nebula-graph-${version}.rpm
```

Replace the above file name with your own file name, otherwise, this command might fail. **Nebula Graph** is installed in the `/usr/local/nebula` directory by default.

## Starting Nebula Graph Services

See the [Start and Stop Nebula Graph Services Doc](../2.install/2.start-stop-service.md) for details.

## Uninstalling

Before uninstalling, please stop the services. If you use rpm to install, use `rpm -qa | grep nebula` command to search for `nebula`, and then pass the result to `rpm -e` to uninstall. For those using deb, you need to uninstall through `dpkg`. Please note that the configuration file will not be deleted after uninstalling.

```bash
# For rpm
$ rpm -qa|grep nebula
nebula-graph-{{ nebula.release }}-1.x86_64
$ sudo rpm -e nebula-graph-{{ nebula.release }}-1.x86_64

# For deb
$ dpkg -l|grep nebula
nebula-graph
$ dpkg -r nebula-graph
```

# Configuration Persistency and Priority

## Configuration Persistency (For Production)

When starting **Nebula Graph** services for the first time, Nebula will read the configuration file from the local (the default path `/usr/local/nebula/etc/`). Then all configuration items (including dynamically changed configuration items) will be **persisted** in the Meta Service. After that, even if restarting **Nebula Graph**, it will only read the configuration from Meta Service.

## Getting the Configuration Locally (For Debugging)

In some debugging scenarios, you need to get the configuration from **local** instead of Meta Service. In this case, add `--local_config = true` at the top of the configuration file. You need to restart the services to make the modifications take effect.

## Changing Method and Read priority

You can also modify **Nebula Graph** configurations with command lines (`UPDATE CONFIG` syntax) in Nebula console or the environment variables. The read priority rules are as follows:

For a configuration:

- Default configuration precedence: meta > `UPDATE CONFIG` > environment variable > configuration files.
- If set `--local_config` to true, the configuration precedence is: configuration files > meta service > environment variable.

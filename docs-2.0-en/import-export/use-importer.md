# NebulaGraph Importer

NebulaGraph Importer (Importer) is a standalone tool for importing data from CSV files into NebulaGraph. Importer can read and batch import CSV file data from multiple data sources, and also supports batch update and delete operations.

## Features

- Support multiple data sources, including local, S3, OSS, HDFS, FTP, SFTP, and GCS.
- Support importing data from CSV format files. A single file can contain multiple tags, multiple edge types or a mix of both.
- Support filtering the data from source.
- Support batch operation, including insert, update, delete.
- Support connecting to multiple Graph services simultaneously for importing and dynamic load balancing.
- Support reconnect or retry after failure.
- Support displaying statistics in multiple dimensions, including import time, import percentage, etc. Support for printing statistics in Console or logs.
- Support SSL.

## Advantage

- Lightweight and fast: no complex environment can be used, fast data import.

- Flexible filtering: You can flexibly filter CSV data through configuration files.

## Version compatibility

The version correspondence between NebulaGraph and NebulaGraph Importer is as follows.

|NebulaGraph version|NebulaGraph Importer version|
|:---|:---|
| 3.x.x      |  3.x.x, 4.x.x        | 
| 2.x.x      |  2.x.x, 3.x.x        |

!!! note

    Importer 4.0.0 has redone the Importer for improved performance, but the configuration file is not compatible with older versions. It is recommended to use the new version of Importer.

## Release note

[Release](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-importer/releases/tag/{{importer.tag}})

## Prerequisites

Before using NebulaGraph Importer, make sure:

- NebulaGraph service has been deployed. The deployment method is as follows:
  
  - [Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose](../2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow.md)
  
  - [Install NebulaGraph with RPM or DEB package](../4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/2.install-nebula-graph-by-rpm-or-deb.md)
  
  - [Install NebulaGraph by compiling the source code](../4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/1.install-nebula-graph-by-compiling-the-source-code.md)

- Schema is created in NebulaGraph, including space, Tag and Edge type, or set by parameter `manager.hooks.before.statements`.

## Steps

Prepare the CSV file to be imported and configure the YAML file to use the tool to batch write data into NebulaGraph.

!!! note

    For details about the YAML configuration file, see [Configuration File Description](#configuration_file_description) at the end of topic.

### Download binary package and run

1. Download the executable [binary package](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-importer/releases/tag/{{importer.tag}}).

  !!! note

        The file installation path based on the RPM/DEB package is `/usr/bin/nebula-importer`. 

2. Under the directory where the binary file is located, run the following command to start importing data.

  ```bash
  ./<binary_file_name> --config <yaml_config_file_path>
  ```

### Source code compile and run

Compiling the source code requires deploying a Golang environment. For details, see [Build Go environment](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-importer/blob/{{importer.branch}}/docs/golang-install-en.md).

1. Clone repository.

  ```bash
  git clone -b {{importer.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-importer.git
  ```

  !!! note
  
        Use the correct branch. Different branches have different RPC protocols.

2. Access the directory `nebula-importer`.

  ```bash
  cd nebula-importer
  ```

3. Compile the source code.

  ```bash
  make build
  ```

4. Start the service.

  ```bash
  ./bin/nebula-importer --config <yaml_config_file_path>
  ```

### Run in Docker mode

Instead of installing the Go locale locally, you can use Docker to pull the [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vesoft/nebula-importer) of the NebulaGraph Importer and mount the local configuration file and CSV data file into the container. The command is as follows:

```bash
docker pull vesoft/nebula-importer:<version>
docker run --rm -ti \
      --network=host \
      -v <config_file>:<config_file> \
      -v <data_dir>:<data_dir> \
      vesoft/nebula-importer:<version> \
      --config <config_file>
```

- `<config_file>`: The absolute path to the YAML configuration file.
- `<data_dir>`: The absolute path to the CSV data file. If the file is not local, ignore this parameter.
- `<version>`: NebulaGraph 3.x Please fill in 'v3'.

!!! note
    A relative path is recommended. If you use a local absolute path, check that the path maps to the path in the Docker.

Example:

```bash
docker pull vesoft/nebula-importer:v4
docker run --rm -ti \
      --network=host \
      -v /home/user/config.yaml:/home/user/config.yaml \
      -v /home/user/data:/home/user/data \
      vesoft/nebula-importer:v4 \
      --config /home/user/config.yaml
```

## Configuration File Description

Various example configuration files are available within the [Github](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-importer/tree/{{importer.branch}}/examples) of the NebulaGraph Importer. The configuration files are used to describe information about the files to be imported, NebulaGraph server information, etc. The following section describes the fields within the configuration file in categories.

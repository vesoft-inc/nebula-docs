# Restart service Pods in a NebulaGraph cluster on K8s

!!! note

    Restarting NebulaGraph cluster service Pods is a feature in the Alpha version.

During routine maintenance, it might be necessary to restart a specific service Pod in the NebulaGraph cluster, for instance, when the Pod's status is abnormal or to enforce a restart. Restarting a Pod essentially means restarting the service process. To ensure high availability, NebulaGraph Operator supports gracefully restarting all Pods of the Graph, Meta, or Storage service respectively and gracefully restarting an individual Pod of the Storage service.

## Prerequisites

A NebulaGraph cluster is created in a K8s environment. For details, see [Create a NebulaGraph cluster](../4.1.installation/4.1.1.cluster-install.md).

## Restart all Pods of a certain service type

To gracefully roll restart all Pods of a certain service type in the cluster, you can add an annotation (`nebula-graph.io/restart-timestamp`) with the current time to the configuration of the StatefulSet controller of the corresponding service.

When NebulaGraph Operator detects that the StatefulSet controller of the corresponding service has the annotation `nebula-graph.io/restart-timestamp` and its value is changed, it triggers the graceful rolling restart operation for all Pods of that service type in the cluster.

In the following example, the annotation is added for all Graph services so that all Pods of these Graph services are restarted one by one.

Assume that the cluster name is `nebula` and the cluster resources are in the `default` namespace. Run the following command:

1. Check the name of the StatefulSet controller.

  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulset 
  ```

  Sample output:

  ```bash
  NAME              READY   AGE
  nebula-graphd     2/2     33s
  nebula-metad      3/3     69s
  nebula-storaged   3/3     69s
  ```

2. Get the current timestamp.

  ```bash
  date -u +%s
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  1700547115
  ```

3. Overwrite the timestamp annotation of the StatefulSet controller to trigger the graceful rolling restart operation.

  ```bash
  kubectl annotate statefulset nebula-graphd nebula-graph.io/restart-timestamp="1700547115" --overwrite
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  statefulset.apps/nebula-graphd annotate
  ```

4. Observe the restart process.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=nebula,app.kubernetes.io/component=graphd -w
  ```
  
  Example output:

  ```bash
  NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  nebula-graphd-0   1/1     Running   0          9m37s
  nebula-graphd-1   0/1     Running   0          17s
  nebula-graphd-1   1/1     Running   0          20s
  nebula-graphd-0   1/1     Terminating   0          9m40s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     Terminating   0          9m41s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     Terminating   0          9m42s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     Terminating   0          9m42s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     Terminating   0          9m42s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     Pending       0          0s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     Pending       0          0s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
  nebula-graphd-0   0/1     Running             0          2s
  ```

  This above output shows the status of Graph service Pods during the restart process.

5. Verify that the StatefulSet controller annotation is updated.

  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulset nebula-graphd -o yaml | grep "nebula-graph.io/restart-timestamp"

  ```

  Example output:

  ```yaml
  nebula-graph.io/last-applied-configuration: '{"persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy":{"whenDeleted":"Retain","whenScaled":"Retain"},"podManagementPolicy":"Parallel","replicas":2,"revisionHistoryLimit":10,"selector":{"matchLabels":{"app.kubernetes.io/cluster":"nebula","app.kubernetes.io/component":"graphd","app.kubernetes.io/managed-by":"nebula-operator","app.kubernetes.io/name":"nebula-graph"}},"serviceName":"nebula-graphd-headless","template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"nebula-graph.io/cm-hash":"7c55c0e5ac74e85f","nebula-graph.io/restart-timestamp":"1700547815"},"creationTimestamp":null,"labels":{"app.kubernetes.io/cluster":"nebula","app.kubernetes.io/component":"graphd","app.kubernetes.io/managed-by":"nebula-operator","app.kubernetes.io/name":"nebula-graph"}},"spec":{"containers":[{"command":["/bin/sh","-ecx","exec
  nebula-graph.io/restart-timestamp: "1700547115"
      nebula-graph.io/restart-timestamp: "1700547815" 
  ```

The above output indicates that the annotation of the StatefulSet controller has been updated, and all graph service Pods has been restarted.


## Restart a single Storage service Pod

To gracefully roll restart a single Storage service Pod, you can add an annotation (`nebula-graph.io/restart-ordinal`) with the value set to the ordinal number of the Storage service Pod you want to restart. This triggers a graceful restart or state transition for that specific Storage service Pod. The added annotation will be automatically removed after the Storage service Pod is restarted.

In the following example, the annotation is added for the Pod with ordinal number `1`, indicating a graceful restart for the `nebula-storaged-1` Storage service Pod.

Assume that the cluster name is `nebula`, and the cluster resources are in the `default` namespace. Run the following commands:

1. Check the name of the StatefulSet controller.

  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulset 
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  NAME              READY   AGE
  nebula-graphd     2/2     33s
  nebula-metad      3/3     69s
  nebula-storaged   3/3     69s
  ```

2. Get the ordinal number of the Storage service Pod.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=nebula,app.kubernetes.io/component=storaged
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  nebula-storaged-0   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-2   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-3   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-4   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-5   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-6   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-7   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-8   1/1     Running   0          13h
  ```

3. Add the annotation for the `nebula-storaged-1` pod to trigger a graceful restart for that specific pod.

  ```bash
  kubectl annotate statefulset nebula-storaged nebula-graph.io/restart-ordinal="1" 
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  statefulset.apps/nebula-storaged annotate
  ```

4. Observe the restart process.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=nebula,app.kubernetes.io/component=storaged -w
  ```

  Example output:

  ```bash
  NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  nebula-storaged-0   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-2   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-3   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-4   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-5   1/1     Running   0          12h
  nebula-storaged-6   1/1     Running   0          12h
  nebula-storaged-7   1/1     Running   0          12h
  nebula-storaged-8   1/1     Running   0          12h
  
  
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Running   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Terminating   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     Terminating   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     Terminating   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     Terminating   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     Terminating   0          13h
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     Pending       0          0s
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     Pending       0          0s
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
  nebula-storaged-1   0/1     Running             0          1s
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Running             0          10s  

The above output indicates that the `nebula-storaged-1` Storage service Pod has been successfully restarted.

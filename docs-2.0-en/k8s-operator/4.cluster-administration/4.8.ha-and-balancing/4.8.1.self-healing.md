# Self-healing

NebulaGraph Operator calls the interface provided by NebulaGraph clusters to dynamically sense cluster service status. Once an exception is detected (for example, a component in a NebulaGraph cluster stops running), NebulaGraph Operator automatically performs fault tolerance. This topic shows how Nebular Operator performs self-healing by simulating cluster failure of deleting one Storage service Pod in a NebulaGraph cluster.

## Prerequisites

[Install NebulaGraph Operator](../../2.get-started/2.1.install-operator.md)

## Steps

1. Create a NebulaGraph cluster. For more information, see [Create a NebulaGraph clusters](../4.1.installation/4.1.1.cluster-install.md).

2. Delete the Pod named `<cluster_name>-storaged-2` after all pods are in the `Running` status.

  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod <cluster-name>-storaged-2 --now
  ```
`<cluster_name>` is the name of your NebulaGraph cluster.

3. NebulaGraph Operator automates the creation of the Pod named `<cluster-name>-storaged-2` to perform self-healing.
   
  Run the `kubectl get pods` command to check the status of the Pod `<cluster-name>-storaged-2`.
   
  ```bash
  ...
  nebula-cluster-storaged-1        1/1     Running             0          5d23h
  nebula-cluster-storaged-2        0/1     ContainerCreating   0          1s
  ...
  ```

  ```bash
  ...
  nebula-cluster-storaged-1        1/1     Running     0          5d23h
  nebula-cluster-storaged-2        1/1     Running     0          4m2s
  ...
  ```
When the status of `<cluster-name>-storaged-2` is changed from `ContainerCreating` to `Running`, the self-healing is performed successfully.

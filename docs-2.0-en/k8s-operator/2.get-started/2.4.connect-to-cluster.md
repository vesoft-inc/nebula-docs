# Connect to a NebulaGraph cluster

After creating a NebulaGraph cluster with NebulaGraph Operator on Kubernetes, you can connect to NebulaGraph databases from within the cluster and outside the cluster.

## Prerequisites

A NebulaGraph cluster is created on Kubernetes. For more information, see [Create a NebulaGraph cluster](2.3.create-cluster.md).

## Connect to NebulaGraph databases from within a NebulaGraph cluster

You can create a `ClusterIP` type Service to provide an access point to the NebulaGraph database for other Pods within the cluster. By using the Service's IP and the Graph service's port number (9669), you can connect to the NebulaGraph database. For more information, see [ClusterIP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

1. Create a file named `graphd-clusterip-service.yaml`. The file contents are as follows:
   
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    labels:
      app.kubernetes.io/cluster: nebula
      app.kubernetes.io/component: graphd
      app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: nebula-operator
      app.kubernetes.io/name: nebula-graph
    name: nebula-graphd-svc
    namespace: default
  spec:
    ports:
    - name: thrift
      port: 9669
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 9669
    - name: http
      port: 19669
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 19669
    selector:
      app.kubernetes.io/cluster: nebula
      app.kubernetes.io/component: graphd
      app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: nebula-operator
      app.kubernetes.io/name: nebula-graph
    type: ClusterIP  # Set the type to ClusterIP.
  ```
  
  - NebulaGraph uses port `9669` by default. `19669` is the HTTP port of the Graph service in a NebulaGraph cluster.
  - `targetPort` is the port mapped to the database Pods, which can be customized.
  
2. Create a ClusterIP Service.

  ```bash	
  kubectl create -f graphd-clusterip-service.yaml	  
  ```	

3. Check the IP of the Service:
   
  ```bash
  $ kubectl get service -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=<nebula>  # <nebula> is the name of your NebulaGraph cluster.
  NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                          AGE
  nebula-graphd-svc          ClusterIP   10.98.213.34   <none>        9669/TCP,19669/TCP,19670/TCP                     23h
  ...
  ```

4. Run the following command to connect to the NebulaGraph database using the IP of the `<cluster-name>-graphd-svc` Service above:

  ```bash
  kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:{{console.tag}} --restart=Never -- <nebula_console_name> -addr <cluster_ip>  -port <service_port> -u <username> -p <password>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:{{console.tag}} --restart=Never -- nebula-console -addr 10.98.213.34  -port 9669 -u root -p vesoft
  ```

  - `--image`: The image for the tool NebulaGraph Console used to connect to NebulaGraph databases.
  - `<nebula-console>`: The custom Pod name.
  - `-addr`: The IP of the `ClusterIP` Service, used to connect to Graphd services.
  - `-port`: The port to connect to Graphd services, the default port of which is `9669`.
  - `-u`: The username of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any existing username. The default username is root.
  - `-p`: The password of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the password.

  A successful connection to the database is indicated if the following is returned:

  ```bash
  If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

  (root@nebula) [(none)]>
  ```

  You can also connect to NebulaGraph databases with **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**. The domain format is `<cluster-name>-graphd.<cluster-namespace>.svc.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>`. The default value of `CLUSTER_DOMAIN` is `cluster.local`.

  ```bash
  kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:{{console.tag}} --restart=Never -- <nebula_console_name> -addr <cluster_name>-graphd-svc.default.svc.cluster.local -port <service_port> -u <username> -p <password>
  ```

  `service_port` is the port to connect to Graphd services, the default port of which is `9669`.

  !!! note

        If the `spec.console` field is set in the cluster configuration file, you can also connect to NebulaGraph databases with the following command:

        ```bash
        # Enter the nebula-console Pod.
        kubectl exec -it nebula-console -- /bin/sh

        # Connect to NebulaGraph databases.
        nebula-console -addr nebula-graphd-svc.default.svc.cluster.local -port 9669 -u <username> -p <password>
        ```

  For information about the nebula-console container, see [nebula-console](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-operator/blob/v{{operator.release}}/doc/user/nebula_console.md#nebula-console).

## Connect to NebulaGraph databases from outside a NebulaGraph cluster via `NodePort`

You can create a `NodePort` type Service to access internal cluster services from outside the cluster using any node IP and the exposed node port. You can also utilize load balancing services provided by cloud vendors (such as Azure, AWS, etc.) by setting the Service type to `LoadBalancer`. This allows external access to internal cluster services through the public IP and port of the load balancer provided by the cloud vendor.

The Service of type `NodePort` forwards the front-end requests via the label selector `spec.selector` to Graphd pods with labels `app.kubernetes.io/cluster: <cluster-name>` and `app.kubernetes.io/component: graphd`.

After creating a NebulaGraph cluster based on the [example template](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-operator/blob/v{{operator.release}}/config/samples/apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml), where `spec.graphd.service.type=NodePort`, the NebulaGraph Operator will automatically create a NodePort type Service named `<cluster-name>-graphd-svc` in the same namespace. You can directly connect to the NebulaGraph database through any node IP and the exposed node port (see step 4 below). You can also create a custom Service according to your needs.

Steps:

1. Create a YAML file named `graphd-nodeport-service.yaml`. The file contents are as follows:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    labels:
      app.kubernetes.io/cluster: nebula
      app.kubernetes.io/component: graphd
      app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: nebula-operator
      app.kubernetes.io/name: nebula-graph
    name: nebula-graphd-svc-nodeport
    namespace: default
  spec:
    externalTrafficPolicy: Local
    ports:
    - name: thrift
      port: 9669
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 9669
    - name: http
      port: 19669
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 19669
    selector:
      app.kubernetes.io/cluster: nebula
      app.kubernetes.io/component: graphd
      app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: nebula-operator
      app.kubernetes.io/name: nebula-graph
    type: NodePort   # Set the type to NodePort.
  ```

  - NebulaGraph uses port `9669` by default. `19669` is the HTTP port of the Graph service in a NebulaGraph cluster.
  - The value of `targetPort` is the port mapped to the database Pods, which can be customized.

2. Run the following command to create a NodePort Service.

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f graphd-nodeport-service.yaml
  ```

3. Check the port mapped on all of your cluster nodes.

  ```bash
  kubectl get services -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=<nebula> # <nebula> is the name of your NebulaGraph cluster.
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  NAME                           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                          AGE
  nebula-graphd-svc-nodeport     NodePort    10.107.153.129 <none>        9669:32236/TCP,19669:31674/TCP,19670:31057/TCP   24h
  ...
  ```

  As you see, the mapped port of NebulaGraph databases on all cluster nodes is `32236`.

4. Connect to NebulaGraph databases with your node IP and the node port above.
  
  ```bash
  kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:{{console.tag}} --restart=Never -- <nebula_console_name> -addr <node_ip> -port <node_port> -u <username> -p <password>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:{{console.tag}} --restart=Never -- nebula-console -addr 192.168.8.24 -port 32236 -u root -p vesoft
  If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

  (root@nebula) [(none)]>
  ```

  - `--image`: The image for the tool NebulaGraph Console used to connect to NebulaGraph databases.
  - `<nebula-console>`: The custom Pod name. The above example uses `nebula-console`.
  - `-addr`: The IP of any node in a NebulaGraph cluster. The above example uses `192.168.8.24`.
  - `-port`: The mapped port of NebulaGraph databases on all cluster nodes. The above example uses `32236`.
  - `-u`: The username of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any existing username. The default username is root.
  - `-p`: The password of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the password.
  
  !!! note

        If the `spec.console` field is set in the cluster configuration file, you can also connect to NebulaGraph databases with the following command:

        ```bash
        # Enter the nebula-console Pod.
        kubectl exec -it nebula-console -- /bin/sh

        # Connect to NebulaGraph databases.
        nebula-console -addr <node_ip> -port <node_port> -u <username> -p <password>
        ```

        For information about the nebula-console container, see [nebula-console](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-operator/blob/v{{operator.release}}/doc/user/nebula_console.md#nebula-console).

## Connect to NebulaGraph databases from outside a NebulaGraph cluster via Ingress

When dealing with multiple pods in a cluster, managing services for each pod separately is not a good practice. Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that provides a unified entry point for accessing multiple services. Ingress can be used to expose multiple services under a single IP address.

Nginx Ingress is an implementation of Kubernetes Ingress. Nginx Ingress watches the Ingress resource of a Kubernetes cluster and generates the Ingress rules into Nginx configurations that enable Nginx to forward 7 layers of traffic.

You can use Nginx Ingress to connect to a NebulaGraph cluster from outside the cluster using a combination of the host network and DaemonSet pattern.

Due to the use of `HostNetwork`, Nginx Ingress pods may be scheduled on the same node (port conflicts will occur when multiple pods try to listen on the same port on the same node). To avoid this situation, Nginx Ingress is deployed on these nodes in DaemonSet mode (ensuring that a pod replica runs on each node in the cluster). You first need to select some nodes and label them for the specific deployment of Nginx Ingress.

Ingress does not support TCP or UDP services. For this reason, the nginx-ingress-controller pod uses the flags `--tcp-services-configmap` and `--udp-services-configmap` to point to an existing ConfigMap where the key refers to the external port to be used and the value refers to the format of the service to be exposed. The format of the value is `<namespace/service_name>:<service_port>`.

For example, the configurations of the ConfigMap named as `tcp-services` is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tcp-services
  namespace: nginx-ingress
data:
  # update 
  9769: "default/nebula-graphd-svc:9669"
```

Steps are as follows.

1. Create a file named `nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml`. 

  Click on [nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-operator/blob/{{operator.tag}}/config/samples/nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml) to view the complete content of the example YAML file.

  !!! note

        The resource objects in the YAML file above use the namespace `nginx-ingress`. You can run `kubectl create namespace nginx-ingress` to create this namespace, or you can customize the namespace.

2. Label a node where the DaemonSet named `nginx-ingress-controller` in the above YAML file (The node used in this example is named `worker2` with an IP of `192.168.8.160`) runs.

  ```bash
  kubectl label node worker2 nginx-ingress=true
  ```

3. Run the following command to enable Nginx Ingress in the cluster you created. 

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f nginx-ingress-daemonset-hostnetwork.yaml
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  configmap/nginx-ingress-controller created
  configmap/tcp-services created
  serviceaccount/nginx-ingress created
  serviceaccount/nginx-ingress-backend created
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created
  role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created
  rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created
  service/nginx-ingress-controller-metrics created
  service/nginx-ingress-default-backend created
  service/nginx-ingress-proxy-tcp created
  daemonset.apps/nginx-ingress-controller created
  ```

  Since the network type that is configured in Nginx Ingress is `hostNetwork`, after successfully deploying Nginx Ingress, with the IP (`192.168.8.160`) of the node where Nginx Ingress is deployed and with the external port (`9769`) you define, you can access NebulaGraph. 

4. Use the IP address and the port configured in the preceding steps. You can connect to NebulaGraph with NebulaGraph Console. 

  ```bash
  kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:{{console.tag}} --restart=Never -- <nebula_console_name> -addr <host_ip> -port <external_port> -u <username> -p <password>
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  kubectl run -ti --image vesoft/nebula-console:{{console.tag}} --restart=Never -- nebula-console -addr 192.168.8.160 -port 9769 -u root -p vesoft
  ```

  - `--image`: The image for the tool NebulaGraph Console used to connect to NebulaGraph databases.
  - `<nebula-console>` The custom Pod name. The above example uses `nebula-console`.
  - `-addr`: The IP of the node where Nginx Ingress is deployed. The above example uses `192.168.8.160`.
  - `-port`: The port used for external network access. The above example uses `9769`.
  - `-u`: The username of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any existing username. The default username is root.
  - `-p`: The password of your NebulaGraph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the password.

  A successful connection to the database is indicated if the following is returned:

  ```bash
  If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
  (root@nebula) [(none)]>
  ```

  !!! note

        If the `spec.console` field is set in the cluster configuration file, you can also connect to NebulaGraph databases with the following command:

        ```bash
        # Enter the nebula-console Pod.
        kubectl exec -it nebula-console -- /bin/sh

        # Connect to NebulaGraph databases.
        nebula-console -addr <ingress_host_ip> -port <external_port> -u <username> -p <password>
        ```

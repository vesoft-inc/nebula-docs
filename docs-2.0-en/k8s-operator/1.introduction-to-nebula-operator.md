# What is NebulaGraph Operator

## Concept

NebulaGraph Operator is a tool to automate the deployment, operation, and maintenance of [NebulaGraph](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula) clusters on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). Building upon the excellent scalability mechanism of Kubernetes, NebulaGraph introduced its operation and maintenance knowledge into the Kubernetes system, which makes NebulaGraph a real cloud-native graph database.

## How it works

For resource types that do not exist within Kubernetes, you can register them by adding custom API objects. The common way is to use the [CustomResourceDefinition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions).

NebulaGraph Operator abstracts the deployment management of NebulaGraph clusters as a CRD. By combining multiple built-in API objects including StatefulSet, Service, and ConfigMap, the routine management and maintenance of a NebulaGraph cluster are coded as a control loop in the Kubernetes system. When a CR instance is submitted, NebulaGraph Operator drives database clusters to the final state according to the control process.

## Features

The following features are already available in NebulaGraph Operator:

- **Cluster deployment and deletion**: NebulaGraph Operator simplifies the process of deploying and uninstalling clusters for users. NebulaGraph Operator allows you to quickly create, update, or delete a NebulaGraph cluster by simply providing the corresponding CR file. For more information, see [Install NebulaGraph Clusters](../k8s-operator/4.cluster-administration/4.1.installation/4.1.1.cluster-install.md).

- **Cluster Upgrade**: NebulaGraph Operator supports cluster upgrading from version {{operator.upgrade_from}} to version {{operator.upgrade_to}}.
  
- **Self-Healing**: NebulaGraph Operator calls interfaces provided by NebulaGraph clusters to dynamically sense cluster service status. Once an exception is detected, NebulaGraph Operator performs fault tolerance. For more information, see [Self-Healing](../k8s-operator/4.cluster-administration/4.8.ha-and-balancing/4.8.1.self-healing.md).
  
- **Balance Scheduling**: Based on the scheduler extension interface, the scheduler provided by NebulaGraph Operator evenly distributes Pods in a NebulaGraph cluster across all nodes.

## Limitations

### Version limitations

NebulaGraph Operator does not support the v1.x version of NebulaGraph. NebulaGraph Operator version and the corresponding NebulaGraph version are as follows:

| NebulaGraph   | NebulaGraph Operator |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| 3.5.x ~ 3.6.0 | 1.5.0 ~ 1.7.x, 1.8.0 |
| 3.0.0 ~ 3.4.1 | 1.3.0, 1.4.0 ~ 1.4.2 |
| 3.0.0 ~ 3.3.x | 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0  |
| 2.5.x ~ 2.6.x | 0.9.0                |
| 2.5.x         | 0.8.0                |

!!! compatibility "Legacy version compatibility"

    - The 1.x version NebulaGraph Operator is not compatible with NebulaGraph of version below v3.x.
    - Starting from NebulaGraph Operator 0.9.0, logs and data are stored separately. Using NebulaGraph Operator 0.9.0 or later versions to manage a NebulaGraph 2.5.x cluster created with Operator 0.8.0 can cause compatibility issues. You can backup the data of the NebulaGraph 2.5.x cluster and then create a 2.6.x cluster with Operator 0.9.0.

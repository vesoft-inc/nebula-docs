# Import data

Studio supports importing data in CSV format into NebulaGraph through an interface.

## Prerequisites

To batch import data, do a check of these:

- The schema has been created in NebulaGraph.

- The CSV files meet the demands of the schema.

- The account has GOD, ADMIN, or DBA permissions. For details, see [Built-in Roles](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

## Entry

In the top navigation bar, click ![download](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/studio-btn-download.png).

Importing data is divided into 2 parts, creating a new data source and creating an import task, which will be described in detail next.

## Create a new data source

Click **New Data Source** in the upper right corner of the page to set the data source and its related settings. Currently, 3 types of data sources are supported.

| Type of data source | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cloud storage | Add cloud storage as the CSV file source, which only supports cloud services compatible with the Amazon S3 interface. 
| SFTP | Add SFTP as the CSV file source. |
| Local file | Upload a local CSV file. The file size can not exceed 200 MB, please put the files exceeding the limit into other types of data sources. |

!!! Note

    - When uploading a local CSV file, you can select more than one CSV file at one time.
    - After adding a data source, you can click **Data Source Management** at the top of the page and switch tabs to view the details of different types of data sources, and you can also edit or delete data sources.

## Create an import task

1. Click **New Import** at the top left corner of the page to complete the following settings:

  !!! caution

        Users can also click **Import Template** to download the sample configuration file `example.yaml`, configure it and then upload the configuration file. Configure in the same way as [NebulaGraph Importer](../../import-export/use-importer.md).

  - **Space**: The name of the graph space where the data needs to be imported.
  - **Task Name**: automatically generated by default, can be modified.
  - (optional)**More configuration**: You can customize the concurrency, batch size, retry times, read concurrency, and import concurrency.
  - **Map Tags**:

    1. Click **Add Tag**, and then select the tag within the added tags below.
    2. Click **Add source file**, select **Data Source Type** and **File Path** in **Data source file**, find the file you need to import, and then click **Add**.
    3. In the preview page, set the file separator and whether to carry the table header, and then click **Confirm**.
    4. Select the corresponding column for VID in **VID Columns**. You can select multiple columns to be merged into a VID, and you can also add a prefix or suffix to the VID.
    5. Select the corresponding column for the attribute in the properties box. For properties that can be `NULL` or have `DEFAULT` set, you can leave the corresponding column unspecified.
    6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 to import all the data files of the Tag selected.
    7. Repeat steps 1 to 6 to import all Tag data.

  - **Map Edges**: Same operation as map tags.

2. After completing the settings, click **Import**, enter the password for the NebulaGraph account, and confirm.

After the import task is created, you can view the progress of the import task in the **Import Data** tab, which supports operations such as filtering tasks based on graph space, editing the task, viewing logs, downloading logs, reimporting, downloading configuration files, and deleting tasks.

## Next

After completing the data import, users can access the [Console](st-ug-console.md) page.

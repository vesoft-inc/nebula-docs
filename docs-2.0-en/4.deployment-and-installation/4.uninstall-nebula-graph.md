# Uninstall NebulaGraph

This topic describes how to uninstall NebulaGraph.

!!! caution

    Before re-installing NebulaGraph on a machine, follow this topic to completely uninstall the old NebulaGraph, in case the remaining data interferes with the new services, including inconsistencies between Meta services.

## Prerequisite

The NebulaGraph services should be stopped before the uninstallation. For more information, see [Manage NebulaGraph services](../2.quick-start/5.start-stop-service.md).

## Step 1: Delete data files of the Storage and Meta Services

If you have modified the `data_path` in the configuration files for the Meta Service and Storage Service, the directories where NebulaGraph stores data may not be in the installation path of NebulaGraph. Check the configuration files to confirm the data paths, and then manually delete the directories to clear all data.

!!! note

    For a NebulaGraph cluster, delete the data files of all Storage and Meta servers.

1. Check the [Storage Service disk settings](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md#disk_configurations). For example:

    ```bash
    ########## Disk ##########
    # Root data path. Split by comma. e.g. --data_path=/disk1/path1/,/disk2/path2/
    # One path per Rocksdb instance.
    --data_path=/nebula/data/storage
    ```

2. Check the Metad Service configurations and find the corresponding metadata directories.

3. Delete the data and the directories found in step 2.

## Step 2: Delete the installation directories

!!! note

    Delete all installation directories, including the `cluster.id` file in them.

The default installation path is `/usr/local/nebula`, which is specified by `--prefix` while installing NebulaGraph.

3. Delete the installation directories.

### Uninstall NebulaGraph deployed with Docker Compose

1. In the `nebula-docker-compose` directory, run the following command to stop the NebulaGraph services.

    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

2. Delete the `nebula-docker-compose` directory.

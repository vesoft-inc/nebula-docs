# NebulaGraph Java

[NebulaGraph Java](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/tree/{{java.branch}}) is a Java client for connecting to and managing the NebulaGraph database.

## Prerequisites

JDK 8 is installed.

## Compatibility with NebulaGraph

See [github](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/tree/{{java.branch}}).

## Download NebulaGraph Java

- (Recommended) To install a specific version of NebulaGraph Java, use the Git option `--branch` to specify the branch. For example, to install v{{ java.release }}, run the following command:

  ```bash
  $ git clone --branch {{java.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java.git
  ```

- To install the daily development version, run the following command to download the source code from the `master` branch:

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java.git
  ```

## Use NebulaGraph Java

!!! note

    We recommend that each thread use one session. If multiple threads use the same session, the performance will be reduced.

When importing a Maven project with tools such as IDEA, set the following dependency in `pom.xml`.

!!! note

    `3.0.0-SNAPSHOT` indicates the daily development version that may have unknown issues. We recommend that you replace `3.0.0-SNAPSHOT` with a released version number to use a table version.

```bash
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.vesoft</groupId>
  <artifactId>client</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

If you cannot download the dependency for the daily development version, set the following content in `pom.xml`. Released versions have no such issue.

```bash
<repositories> 
  <repository> 
    <id>snapshots</id> 
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url> 
  </repository> 
</repositories>
```

If there is no Maven to manage the project, manually download the [JAR file](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vesoft/) to install NebulaGraph Java.

## Core of the example code

The NebulaGraph Java client provides both Connection Pool and Session Pool modes, using Connection Pool requires the user to manage session instances.

- Session Pool

  For all the code, see [GraphSessionPoolExample](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/blob/{{java.branch}}/examples/src/main/java/com/vesoft/nebula/examples/GraphSessionPoolExample.java).

- Connection Pool

  For all the code, see [GraphClientExample](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/blob/{{java.branch}}/examples/src/main/java/com/vesoft/nebula/examples/GraphClientExample.java).

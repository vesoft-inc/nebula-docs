# NebulaGraph Algorithm

[NebulaGraph Algorithm](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm) (Algorithm) is a Spark application based on [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/). It uses a complete algorithm tool to perform graph computing on the data in the NebulaGraph database by submitting a Spark task. You can also programmatically use the algorithm under the lib repository to perform graph computing on DataFrame.

## Version compatibility

The correspondence between the NebulaGraph Algorithm release and the NebulaGraph core release is as follows.

|NebulaGraph |NebulaGraph Algorithm |
|:---|:---|
|  nightly         |  3.0-SNAPSHOT |
| 3.0.0 ~ 3.4.x      |  3.x.0        |
| 2.6.x            |  2.6.x        | 
| 2.5.0、2.5.1      |  2.5.0        | 
| 2.0.0、2.0.1      |  2.1.0        |

## Prerequisites

Before using the NebulaGraph Algorithm, users need to confirm the following information:

- The NebulaGraph services have been deployed and started. For details, see [NebulaGraph Installation](../4.deployment-and-installation/1.resource-preparations.md).

- The Spark version is 2.4.x.

- The Scala version is 2.11.

- (Optional) If users need to clone, compile, and package the latest Algorithm in Github, install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

## Limitations

Graph computing outputs vertex datasets, and the algorithm results are stored in DataFrames as the properties of vertices. You can do further operations such as statistics and filtering according to your business requirements.

!!!

    Before Algorithm v3.1.0, when submitting the algorithm package directly, the data of the vertex ID must be an integer. That is, the vertex ID can be INT or String, but the data itself is an integer.

## Supported algorithms

!!! note

    When writing the algorithm results into the NebulaGraph, make sure that the tag in the corresponding graph space has properties names and data types corresponding to the table above.

## Implementation methods

NebulaGraph Algorithm implements the graph calculating as follows:

1. Read the graph data of DataFrame from the NebulaGraph database using the NebulaGraph Spark Connector.

2. Transform the graph data of DataFrame to the GraphX graph.

3. Use graph algorithms provided by GraphX (such as PageRank) or self-implemented algorithms (such as Louvain).

For detailed implementation methods, see [Scala file](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/tree/master/nebula-algorithm/src/main/scala/com/vesoft/nebula/algorithm/lib).

## Get NebulaGraph Algorithm

### Compile and package

1. Clone the repository `nebula-algorithm`.

  ```bash
  $ git clone -b {{algorithm.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm.git
  ```

2. Enter the directory `nebula-algorithm`.

  ```bash
  $ cd nebula-algorithm
  ```

3. Compile and package.

  ```bash
  $ mvn clean package -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  ```

After the compilation, a similar file `nebula-algorithm-3.x.x.jar` is generated in the directory `nebula-algorithm/target`.

### Download maven from the remote repository

[Download address](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vesoft/nebula-algorithm/)

## How to use

### Use algorithm interface (recommended)

The `lib` repository provides 10 common graph algorithms.

1. Add dependencies to the file `pom.xml`.

  ```bash
  <dependency>
       <groupId>com.vesoft</groupId>
       <artifactId>nebula-algorithm</artifactId>
       <version>{{algorithm.release}}</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

2. Use the algorithm (take PageRank as an example) by filling in parameters. For more examples, see [example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/tree/master/example/src/main/scala/com/vesoft/nebula/algorithm).

  !!! note
        By default, the DataFrame that executes the algorithm sets the first column as the starting vertex, the second column as the destination vertex, and the third column as the edge weights (not the rank in the NebulaGraph).

  ```bash
  val prConfig = new PRConfig(5, 1.0)
  val prResult = PageRankAlgo.apply(spark, data, prConfig, false)
  ```
  
  If your vertex IDs are Strings, see [Pagerank Example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/blob/master/example/src/main/scala/com/vesoft/nebula/algorithm/PageRankExample.scala) for how to encoding and decoding them.

### Submit the algorithm package directly

  !!! note

        When `sink: nebula` is configured, it means that the algorithm results will be written back to the NebulaGraph cluster. The property names of the tag have implicit conventions. For details, see **Supported algorithms** section of this topic.

2. Submit the graph computing task.

  ```bash
  ${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit --master <mode> --class com.vesoft.nebula.algorithm.Main <nebula-algorithm-{{algorithm.release}}.jar_path> -p <application.conf_path>
  ```

  Example:

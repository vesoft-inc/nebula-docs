# Storage Service configurations

NebulaGraph provides two initial configuration files for the Storage Service, `nebula-storaged.conf.default` and `nebula-storaged.conf.production`. Users can use them in different scenarios conveniently. The default file path is `/usr/local/nebula/etc/`.

!!! caution

    * It is not recommended to modify the value of `local_config` to `false`. If modified, the NebulaGraph service will first read the cached configurations, which may cause configuration inconsistencies between clusters and cause unknown risks.
    * It is not recommended to modify the configurations that are not introduced in this topic, unless you are familiar with the source code and fully understand the function of configurations.

## How to use the configuration files

To use the initial configuration file, choose one of the above two files and delete the suffix `.default` or `.production` from the initial configuration file for the Meta Service to apply the configurations defined in it.

## About parameter values

If a parameter is not set in the configuration file, NebulaGraph uses the default value. Not all parameters are predefined. And the predefined parameters in the two initial configuration files are different. This topic uses the parameters in `nebula-metad.conf.default`. For parameters that are not included in `nebula-metad.conf.default`, see `nebula-storaged.conf.production`.

!!! caution

    Some parameter values in the configuration file can be dynamically modified during runtime. We label these parameters as **Yes** that supports runtime dynamic modification in this article. When the `local_config` value is set to `true`, the dynamically modified configuration is not persisted, and the configuration will be restored to the initial configuration after the service is restarted. For more information, see [Modify configurations](1.configurations.md).

!!! Note

    The configurations of the Raft Listener and the Storage service are different. For details, see [Deploy Raft listener](../../4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/3.deploy-listener.md).

For all parameters and their current values, see [Configurations](1.configurations.md).

## Basics configurations

| Name         | Predefined value                   | Description              |Whether supports runtime dynamic modifications|
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :------------------|:------------------|
| `daemonize`  | `true`                   | When set to `true`, the process is a daemon process. |  No|
| `pid_file`   | `pids/nebula-storaged.pid` | The file that records the process ID. |  No|
| `timezone_name` | `UTC+00:00:00` | Specifies the NebulaGraph time zone. This parameter is not predefined in the initial configuration files, if you need to use this parameter, add it manually. For the format of the parameter value, see [Specifying the Time Zone with TZ](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html "Click to view the timezone-related content in the GNU C Library manual"). For example, `--timezone_name=UTC+08:00` represents the GMT+8 time zone. |  No|
| `local_config` | `true` | When set to `true`, the process gets configurations from the configuration files. |  No|

!!! note

    * While inserting property values of [time types](../../3.ngql-guide/3.data-types/4.date-and-time.md), NebulaGraph transforms time types (except TIMESTAMP) to the corresponding UTC according to the time zone specified by `timezone_name`. The time-type values returned by nGQL queries are all UTC.
    * `timezone_name` is only used to transform the data stored in NebulaGraph. Other time-related data of the NebulaGraph processes still uses the default time zone of the host, such as the log printing time.

## Memory Tracker configurations

For details about Memory Tracker, see [Memory Tracker: Memory Management Practice in NebulaGraph Database](https://www.nebula-graph.io/posts/memory-tracker-practices)

| Name                 | Predefined value                   | Description                               |Whether supports runtime dynamic modifications|
| :------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |:------------------|
|`memory_tracker_limit_ratio`    |`0.8`  | The value of this parameter can be set to `(0, 1]`, `2`, and `3`.<br/>`(0, 1]`: The percentage of free memory. When the free memory is lower than this value, NebulaGraph stops accepting queries. <br/> Calculated as follows: <br/> `Free memory / (Total memory - Reserved memory)` <br/> **Note**: For clusters with a mixed-used environment, the value of `memory_tracker_limit_ratio` should be set to a **lower** value. For example, when Graphd is expected to occupy only 50% of memory, the value can be set to less than `0.5`.<br/>`2`: Dynamic Self Adaptive mode. MemoryTracker dynamically adjusts the available memory based on the system's current available memory. <br/>**Note**: This feature is experimental. As memory usage cannot be monitored in real time in dynamic adaptive mode, an OOM error may still occur to handle large memory allocations. <br/>`3`: Disable MemoryTracker. MemoryTracker only logs memory usage and does not interfere with executions even if the limit is exceeded.| Yes|
|`memory_tracker_untracked_reserved_memory_mb`    |`50`| The reserved memory that is not tracked by the Memory Tracker. Unit: MB.| Yes|
|`memory_tracker_detail_log`    |`false` | Whether to enable the Memory Tracker log. When the value is `true`, the Memory Tracker log is generated.| Yes|
|`memory_tracker_detail_log_interval_ms`    |`60000`| The time interval for generating the Memory Tracker log. Unit: Millisecond. `memory_tracker_detail_log` is `true` when this parameter takes effect.| Yes|
|`memory_purge_enabled`    |`true` |Whether to enable the memory purge feature. When the value is `true`, the memory purge feature is enabled.| Yes|
|`memory_purge_interval_seconds`    |`10` |The time interval for the memory purge feature to purge memory. Unit: Second. This parameter only takes effect if `memory_purge_enabled` is set to true.| Yes|

## For super-Large vertices

When the query starting from each vertex gets an edge, truncate it directly to avoid too many neighboring edges on the super-large vertex, because a single query occupies too much hard disk and memory. Or you can truncate a certain number of edges specified in the `Max_edge_returned_per_vertex` parameter. Excess edges will not be returned. This parameter applies to all spaces.

| Property name                   | Default value                    | Description  |Whether supports runtime dynamic modifications|
| :------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |:------------------|
| max_edge_returned_per_vertex | `2147483647` | Specifies the maximum number of edges returned for each dense vertex. Excess edges are truncated and not returned. This parameter is not predefined in the initial configuration files, if you need to use this parameter, add it manually. | No|

## Storage configurations for large dataset

!!! warning

    One graph space takes up at least about 300 MB of memory.

When you have a large dataset (in the RocksDB directory) and your memory is tight, we suggest that you set the `enable_partitioned_index_filter` parameter to `true`. The performance is affected because RocksDB indexes are cached.

# CREATE EDGE

`CREATE EDGE` creates an edge type with the given name in a graph space.

## OpenCypher compatibility

Edge types in nGQL are similar to relationship types in openCypher. But they are also quite different. For example, the ways to create them are different.

* In openCypher, relationship types are created together with vertices in `CREATE` statements.
* In nGQL, edge types are created separately using `CREATE EDGE` statements. Edge types in nGQL are more like tables in MySQL.

## Prerequisites

Running the `CREATE EDGE` statement requires some [privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md) for the graph space. Otherwise, NebulaGraph throws an error.

## Syntax

To create an edge type in a specific graph space, you must specify the current working space with the `USE` statement.

```ngql
CREATE EDGE [IF NOT EXISTS] <edge_type_name>
    (
      <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']
      [{, <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']} ...] 
    )
    [TTL_DURATION = <ttl_duration>]
    [TTL_COL = <prop_name>]
    [COMMENT = '<comment>'];
```

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`IF NOT EXISTS`|Detects if the edge type that you want to create exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The edge type existence detection here only compares the edge type names (excluding properties).|
|`<edge_type_name>`|1. The edge type name must be **unique** in a graph space.<br/> 2. Once the edge type name is set, it can not be altered.<br/> 3. By default, the name only supports 1-4 byte UTF-8 encoded characters, including English letters (case sensitive), numbers, Chinese characters, etc. However, it cannot include special characters other than the underscore (_), and cannot start with a number.<br/> 4. To use special characters, reserved keywords, or start with a number, quote the entire name with backticks (\`) and do not include periods (`.`) within the pair of backticks (\`). For more information, see [Keywords and reserved words](../../3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/keywords-and-reserved-words.md). <br/>**Note**:<br/>1. If you name an edge type in Chinese and encounter a `SyntaxError`, you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (\`). <br/>2. To include a backtick (\`) in an edge type name, use a backslash to escape the backtick, such as \\\`; to include a backslash, the backslash itself also needs to be escaped, such as \\\ . |
|`<prop_name>`|The name of the property. It must be unique for each edge type. The rules for permitted property names are the same as those for edge type names.|
|`<data_type>`|The data type of the property. The following data types are supported: [Numeric](../3.data-types/1.numeric.md), [Boolean](../3.data-types/2.boolean.md), [String](../3.data-types/3.string.md), [Date and time](../3.data-types/4.date-and-time.md), and [Geography](../3.data-types/10.geography.md).|
|`NULL | NOT NULL`|Specifies if the property supports `NULL | NOT NULL`. The default value is `NULL`. `DEFAULT` must be specified if `NOT NULL` is set.|
|`DEFAULT`|Specifies a default value for a property. The default value can be a literal value or an expression supported by NebulaGraph. If no value is specified, the default value is used when inserting a new edge.|
|`COMMENT`|The remarks of a certain property or the edge type itself. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on an edge type.|
|`TTL_DURATION`|Specifies the life cycle for the property. The property that exceeds the specified TTL expires. The expiration threshold is the `TTL_COL` value plus the `TTL_DURATION`. The default value of `TTL_DURATION` is `0`. It means the data never expires.|
|`TTL_COL`|Specifies the property to set a timeout on. The data type of the property must be `int` or `timestamp`. An edge type can only specify one field as `TTL_COL`. For more information on TTL, see [TTL options](../8.clauses-and-options/ttl-options.md).|

### Examples

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS follow(degree int);

# The following example creates an edge type with no properties.
nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS no_property();

# The following example creates an edge type with a default value.
nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS follow_with_default(degree int DEFAULT 20);

# In the following example, the TTL of the p2 field is set to be 100 seconds.
nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS e1(p1 string, p2 int, p3 timestamp) \
        TTL_DURATION = 100, TTL_COL = "p2";
```

# Metrics

This topic will describe the monitoring metrics in Nebula Dashboard.

!!! note

    The default unit in **Disk** and **Network** is byte. The unit will change with the data magnitude as the page displays. For example, when the flow is less than 1 KB/s, the unit will be Bytes/s.

## Service

### Period

The period is the time range of counting metrics. It currently supports 5 seconds, 60 seconds, 600 seconds, and 3600 seconds, which respectively represent the last 5 seconds, the last 1 minute, the last 10 minutes, and the last 1 hour.

### Metric methods

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`rate`| The average rate of operations per second in a period. |
|`sum`| The sum of operations in the period. |
|`avg`| The average latency in the cycle. |
|`P75`| The 75th percentile latency. |
|`P95`| The 95th percentile latency. |
|`P99`| The 99th percentile latency. |
|`P999`| The 99.9th percentile latency. |

### Graph

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`num_queries`| The number of queries. |
|`num_slow_queries`| The number of slow queries. |
|`query_latency_us`| The average latency of queries. |
|`slow_query_latency_us`| The average latency of slow queries. |
|`num_query_errors`| The number of queries in error. |

### Meta

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`heartbeat_latency_us`| The latency of heartbeats. |
|`num_heartbeats`| The number of heartbeats. |

### Storage

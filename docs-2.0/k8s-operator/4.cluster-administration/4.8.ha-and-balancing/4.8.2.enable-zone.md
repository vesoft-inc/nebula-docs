# Enable zones

NebulaGraph Operator supports the use of zones. A zone is a logical rack used to group Storage Pods within a cluster. Zones help improve the resilience of the cluster by ensuring an even distribution of data replicas across each zone. This topic explains how to create a cluster with zones.

## Prerequisites

A cluster is created using NebulaGraph Operator. For details on creating a cluster, see [Create a NebulaGraph cluster](../4.1.installation/4.1.1.cluster-install.md).

## Background

NebulaGraph efficiently manages its distributed architecture using the functionality provided by zones. The data in NebulaGraph is divided into different partitions, and replicas of these partitions are evenly distributed across all available zones. Queries can be directed preferentially to the Storage Pods within the same zone. Using zones significantly reduces the network traffic costs between zones and improves data transfer speed. For more detailed information about zones, see [Managing zones](../../../4.deployment-and-installation/5.zone.md).

## Configure zones

To make full use of the Zone feature, you first need to determine the actual Zones in which the nodes of the cluster reside. Typically, nodes deployed on cloud platforms come with labels indicating their respective Zones. 

Once you have this information, you can configure it by setting the `spec.metad.config.zone_list` parameter in the cluster's configuration file. This parameter is a comma-separated list of Zone names and should match the actual Zone names of the nodes. For example, if your nodes are actually in the az1, az2, and az3 regions, the configuration should look like this:

```yaml
spec:
  metad:
    config:
      zone_list: az1, az2, az3
```

NebulaGraph Operator utilizes Kubernetes's [TopoloySpread](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/) feature to manage the scheduling of Storage Pods and Graph Pods. Once `zone_list` is configured, Storage Pods will be automatically assigned to their respective Zones based on the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label.

## Prioritize intra-zone data access

For intra-zone data access, the Graph service dynamically assigns itself to a zone using the `--assigned_zone=$NODE_ZONE` parameter. The Alpine Linux image specified in `spec.alpineImage` (default: `reg.vesoft-inc.com/nebula-alpine:latest`) plays a role in obtaining zone information. It identifies the zone name of the node where the Graph service resides by utilizing an init-container to fetch this information.

By setting `spec.graphd.config.prioritize_intra_zone_reading` to `true` in the cluster configuration file, you enable the Graph service to prioritize sending queries to Storage services within the same zone. In the event of a read failure within that zone, the behavior depends on the value of `spec.graphd.config.stick_to_intra_zone_on_failure`. If set to `true`, the Graph service avoids reading data from other zones and returns an error. Otherwise, it reads data from leader partition replicas in other zones.

```yaml
spec:
  alpineImage: reg.vesoft-inc.com/xxx/xxx:latest
  graphd:
    config:
      prioritize_intra_zone_reading: "true"
      stick_to_intra_zone_on_failure: "false"
```

## Required parameters

If you need to create a cluster with zones, you must add the following parameters to the cluster configuration file. For other fields and descriptions, see [Create a NebulaGraph cluster](../4.1.installation/4.1.1.cluster-install.md).

```yaml
spec:
  # Used to obtain the zone information of the node.
  alpineImage: "reg.example-inc.com/xxx/xxx:latest"
  graphd:
    image: reg.example-inc.com/xxx/xxx
    config:
      # Prioritize sending queries to storage nodes within the same zone.
      prioritize_intra_zone_reading: "true"
      stick_to_intra_zone_on_failure: "false" 
  metad:
    image: reg.example-inc.com/xxx/xxx
    config:
      # List of zone names, separated by commas. It is recommended to set an odd number.
      zone_list: az1,az2,az3 
    licenseManagerURL: "192.168.8.xxx:9119"
  storaged:
    image: reg.example-inc.com/xxx/xxx
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: nebula-image
  # Used to schedule the restart of Graph/Storage Pods to the original zone.
  schedulerName: nebula-scheduler
  # Field used to control the distribution of Storage Pods.
  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - topologyKey: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
    whenUnsatisfiable: "DoNotSchedule"
```

Parameters in the above table are described as follows:

| Parameter    | Default value  | Description    |
| :---- | :--- | :--- |
| `spec.metad.licenseManagerURL` | - | Configure the URL that points to the LM, which consists of the access address and port number (default port `9119`) of the LM. For example, `192.168.8.xxx:9119`. **You must configure this parameter in order to obtain the license information; otherwise, the enterprise edition cluster cannot be used.** |
|`spec.<graphd|metad|storaged>.image`|-|The container image of the Graph, Meta, or Storage service of the enterprise edition.|
|`spec.imagePullSecrets`| - |Specifies the Secret for pulling the NebulaGraph Enterprise service images from a private repository.|
|`spec.alpineImage`|-|The Alpine Linux image, used to obtain the zone information where nodes are located.| 
|`spec.metad.config.zone_list`|-|A list of zone names, split by comma. For example: zone1,zone2,zone3. <br/>**Zone names CANNOT be modified once be set.**|
|`spec.graphd.config.prioritize_intra_zone_reading`|`false`|Specifies whether to prioritize sending queries to the storage pods in the same zone.<br/>When set to `true`, the query is sent to the storage pods in the same zone. If reading fails in that zone, it will decide based on `stick_to_intra_zone_on_failure` whether to read the leader partition replica data from other zones. |
|`spec.graphd.config.stick_to_intra_zone_on_failure`|`false`|Specifies whether to stick to intra-zone routing if unable to find the requested partitions in the same zone. When set to `true`, if unable to find the partition replica in that zone, it does not read data from other zones.|
|`spec.schedulerName`|`kube-scheduler`|Schedules the restarted Graph and Storage pods to the same zone. The value must be set to `nebula-scheduler`.|
|`spec.topologySpreadConstraints`|-| It is a field in Kubernetes used to control the distribution of storage Pods. Its purpose is to ensure that your storage Pods are evenly spread across zones. <br/>**To use the zone feature, you must set the value of `topologySpreadConstraints[0].topologyKey` to `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and the value of `topologySpreadConstraints[0].whenUnsatisfiable` to `DoNotSchedule`**. Run `kubectl get node --show-labels` to check the key. For more information, see [TopologySpread](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/#example-multiple-topologyspreadconstraints).|


!!! warning

    DO NOT manually modify the configmaps created by NebulaGraph Operator. Doing so may cause unexpected behavior. 

    Once Storage and Graph services are assigned to zones, the mapping between the pod and its corresponding zone is stored in a configmap named `<cluster_name>-graphd|storaged-zone`. This mapping facilitates pod scheduling during rolling updates and pod restarts, ensuring that services return to their original zones as needed.    

!!! caution

    Make sure storage Pods are evenly distributed across zones before ingesting data by running `SHOW ZONES` in nebula-console. For zone-related commands, see [Zones](../../../4.deployment-and-installation/5.zone.md).

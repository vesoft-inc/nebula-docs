# Nebula Algorithm

[Nebula Algorithm](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm) (Algorithm) is a Spark application based on [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/). It uses a complete algorithm tool to perform graph computing on the data in the Nebula Graph database by submitting a Spark task. You can also programmatically use the algorithm under the lib repository to perform graph computing on DataFrame.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Nebula Algorithm, users need to confirm the following information:

- The Nebula Graph services have been deployed and started. For details, see [Nebula Installation](4.deployment-and-installation/1.resource-preparations.md).

- The Spark version is 2.4.x.

- The Scala version is 2.11.

- (Optional) If users need to clone, compile, and package the latest Algorithm in Github, install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

## Limitations

- The data of the vertex ID must be an integer. That is, the vertex ID can be INT or String, but the data itself is an integer.

- For non-integer String data, it is recommended to use the algorithm interface. You can use the `dense_rank` function of SparkSQL to encode the data as the Long type instead of the String type.

- Graph computing outputs vertex datasets, and the algorithm results are stored in DataFrames as the properties of vertices. You can do further operations such as statistics and filtering according to your business requirements.

## Supported algorithms

The graph computing algorithms supported by Nebula Algorithm are as follows.

| Algorithm | Description| Scenario|
| :-- |:--  | :--|
| PageRank  | The rank of pages| Web page ranking, key node mining|
| Louvain   | Community discovery | Community mining, hierarchical clustering|  
| KCore     | K core | Community discovery, financial risk control|
| LabelPropagation | Label propagation | Information spreading, advertising, and community discovery|
| ConnectedComponent | Connected component | Community discovery, island discovery|
| StronglyConnectedComponent |Strongly connected component  | Community discovery |
| ShortestPath     |The shortest path | Path planning, network planning |
| TriangleCount    |Triangle counting | Network structure analysis|
|  GraphTriangleCount | Graph triangle counting | Network structure and tightness analysis|
| BetweennessCentrality | Intermediate centrality | Key node mining, node influence computing |
| DegreeStatic    |Degree of statistical | Graph structure analysis|

## Implementation methods

Nebula Algorithm implements the graph calculating as follows:

1. Read the graph data of DataFrame from the Nebula Graph database using the Nebula Spark Connector.

2. Transform the graph data of DataFrame to the GraphX graph.

3. Use graph algorithms provided by GraphX (such as PageRank) or self-implemented algorithms (such as Louvain).

For detailed implementation methods, see [Scala file](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/tree/master/nebula-algorithm/src/main/scala/com/vesoft/nebula/algorithm/lib).

## Get Nebula Algorithm

### Compile and package

1. Clone the repository `nebula-algorithm`.

  ```bash
  $ git clone -b {{algorithm.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm.git
  ```

2. Enter the directory `nebula-algorithm`.

  ```bash
  $ cd nebula-algorithm
  ```

3. Compile and package.

  ```bash
  $ mvn clean package -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  ```

After the compilation, a similar file `nebula-algorithm-{{algorithm.release}}.jar` is generated in the directory `nebula-algorithm/target`.

### Download maven from the remote repository

[Download address](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vesoft/nebula-algorithm/{{algorithm.release}}/)

## How to use

### Use algorithm interface (recommended)

The `lib` repository provides 10 common graph algorithms.

1. Add dependencies to the file `pom.xml`.

  ```bash
  <dependency>
       <groupId>com.vesoft</groupId>
       <artifactId>nebula-algorithm</artifactId>
       <version>{{algorithm.release}}</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

2. Use the algorithm (take PageRank as an example) by filling in parameters. For more example, see [example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/tree/{{algorithm.branch}}/example/src/main/scala/com/vesoft/nebula/algorithm).

  !!! note
        By default, the DataFrame that executes the algorithm sets the first column as the starting vertex, the second column as the destination vertex, and the third column as the edge weights (not the rank in the Nebula Graph).

  ```bash
  val prConfig = new PRConfig(5, 1.0)
  val louvainResult = PageRankAlgo.apply(spark, data, prConfig, false)
  ```

### Submit the algorithm package directly

!!! note
    There are limitations to use sealed packages. For example, when sinking a repository into Nebula Graph, the property name of the tag created in the sunk graph space must match the preset name in the code. The first method is recommended if the user has development skills.

1. Set the [Configuration file](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-algorithm/blob/{{algorithm.branch}}/nebula-algorithm/src/main/resources/application.conf).

  ```bash

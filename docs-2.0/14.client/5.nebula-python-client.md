# NebulaGraph Python

[NebulaGraph Python](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/tree/{{python.branch}}) is a Python client for connecting to and managing the NebulaGraph database.

## Prerequisites

You have installed Python 3.6 or later versions.

## Compatibility with NebulaGraph

See [github](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/tree/{{python.branch}}).

## Install NebulaGraph Python

### Install NebulaGraph Python with pip

```bash
$ pip install nebula3-python==<version>
```

### Install NebulaGraph Python from the source code

1. Clone the NebulaGraph Python source code to the host.

  - (Recommended) To install a specific version of NebulaGraph Python, use the Git option `--branch` to specify the branch. For example, to install v{{ python.release }}, run the following command:

    ```bash
    $ git clone --branch {{python.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python.git
    ```

  - To install the daily development version, run the following command to download the source code from the `master` branch:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python.git
    ```

## Core of the example code


NebulaGraph Python clients provides Connection Pool and Session Pool methods to connect to NebulaGraph. Using the Connection Pool method requires users to manage sessions by themselves.

- Session Pool

  For details about all the code, see [SessinPoolExample.py](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/blob/{{python.branch}}/example/SessinPoolExample.py).

  For limitations of using the Session Pool method, see [Example of using session pool](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/blob/{{python.branch}}/README.md#example-of-using-session-pool).

- Connection Pool

  For details about all the code, see [Example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/tree/{{python.branch}}/example).

# Execution plan

Nebula Graph {{ nebula.release }} applies rule-based execution plans. Users cannot change execution plans, precompile queries and corresponding plan cache, or accelerate queries by specifying indexes.

To view the execution plan and executive summary, see [EXPLAIN and PROFILE](../3.ngql-guide/17.query-tuning-statements/1.explain-and-profile.md).

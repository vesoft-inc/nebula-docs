# Nebula Console

Nebula Console is a native CLI client for Nebula Graph. It can be used to connect a Nebula Graph cluster and execute queries. It can also support special commands to manage parameters, export query results, import test datasets, etc. This topic describes these special commands.

To connect Nebula Graph using Nebula Console, see [Step 3: Connect to Nebula Graph](2.quick-start/3.connect-to-nebula-graph.md).

!!! note

    The commands are case insensitive.

## Manage parameters

You can save parameters for parameterized queries.

!!! note

    - Setting a parameter as a VID in a query is not supported.

    - Parameters are not supported in `SAMPLE` clauses.

    - Parameters are deleted when their sessions are released.

- The command to save a parameter is as follows:

  ```ngql
  nebula> :param <param_name> => <param_value>;
  ```

  The example is as follows:

  ```ngql
  nebula> :param p1 => "Tim Duncan";
  nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:$p1})-[:follow]->(n)  RETURN v,n;
  +----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | v                                                  | n                                                     |
  +----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | ("player100" :player{age: 42, name: "Tim Duncan"}) | ("player125" :player{age: 41, name: "Manu Ginobili"}) |
  | ("player100" :player{age: 42, name: "Tim Duncan"}) | ("player101" :player{age: 36, name: "Tony Parker"})   |
  +----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  nebula> :param p2 => {"a":3,"b":false,"c":"Tim Duncan"};
  nebula> RETURN $p2.b AS b;
  +-------+
  | b     |
  +-------+
  | false |
  +-------+
  ```

- The command to view the saved parameters is as follows:

  ```ngql
  nebula> :params;
  ```

- The command to delete a specified parameter is as follows:

  ```ngql
  nebula> :param <param_name> =>;
  ```

## Export query results

Export query results,  which can be saved as a CSV file or DOT file.

!!! note

    - A file will be saved in the working directory, i.e., what the linux command `pwd` shows.

    - This command only works for the next query statement.

    - You can copy the contents of the DOT file and paste them in [GraphvizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) to generate a visualized execution plan.

- The command to export a csv file is as follows:

  ```ngql
  nebula> :CSV <file_name.csv>;
  ```

- The command to export a DOT file is as follows:

  ```ngql
  nebula> :dot <file_name.dot>
  ```

  The example is as follows:

  ```ngql
  nebula> :dot a.dot
  nebula> PROFILE FORMAT="dot" GO FROM "player100" OVER follow;
  ```

## Import a testing dataset

The testing dataset is named `basketballplayer`. To view details about the schema and data, use the corresponding `SHOW` command.

The command to import a testing dataset is as follows:

```ngql
nebula> :play basketballplayer
```

## Run a command multiple times

To run a command multiple times, use the following command:

```ngql
nebula> :repeat N
```

The example is as follows:

```ngql
nebula> :repeat 3
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD dst(edge);
+-------------+
| dst(EDGE)   |
+-------------+
| "player101" |
| "player125" |
+-------------+
Got 2 rows (time spent 2602/3214 us)

+-------------+
| dst(EDGE)   |
+-------------+
| "player101" |
| "player125" |
+-------------+
Got 2 rows (time spent 583/849 us)

Fri, 20 Aug 2021 06:36:05 UTC

+-------------+
| dst(EDGE)   |
+-------------+
| "player101" |
| "player125" |
+-------------+
Got 2 rows (time spent 496/671 us)

Executed 3 times, (total time spent 3681/4734 us), (average time spent 1227/1578 us)
```

## Sleep to wait

This command will make Nebula Graph services sleep and wait for N seconds. The schema is altered in an async way and takes effect in the next heartbeat cycle. Therefore, this command is usually used when altering schema. The command is as follows:

```ngql
nebula> :sleep N
```

## Disconnect Nebula Console from Nebula Graph

You can use `:EXIT` or `:QUIT` to disconnect from Nebula Graph. For convenience, Nebula Console supports using these commands in lower case without the colon (":"), such as `quit`.

The example is as follows:

```ngql
nebula> :QUIT

Bye root!
```

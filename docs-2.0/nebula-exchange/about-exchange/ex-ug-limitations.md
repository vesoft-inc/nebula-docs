# Limitations

This topic describes some of the limitations of using Exchange 3.x.

## Environment

Exchange 3.x supports the following operating systems:

- CentOS 7
- macOS

## Software dependencies

To ensure the healthy operation of Exchange, ensure that the following software has been installed on the machine:

- Java version 1.8

- Scala version 2.10.7, 2.11.12, or 2.12.10

- Apache Spark. The requirements for Spark versions when using Exchange to export data from data sources are as follows. In the following table, Y means that the corresponding Spark version is supported, and N means not supported.

  !!! note
        Use the correct Exchange JAR file based on the Spark version. For example, for Spark version 2.4, use nebula-exchange_spark_2.4-{{exchange.release}}.jar.

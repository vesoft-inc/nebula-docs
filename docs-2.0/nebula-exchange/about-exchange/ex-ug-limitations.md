# Limitations

This topic describes some of the limitations of using Exchange 2.x.

## NebulaGraph releases

The correspondence between the Nebula Exchange release (the JAR version) and the NebulaGraph release is as follows.

|Exchange client|NebulaGraph|
|:---|:---|
|2.5-SNAPSHOT|nightly|
|{{exchange.release}}|{{nebula.release}}|
|2.5.1|2.5.0„ÄÅ2.5.1|
|2.5.0|2.5.0, 2.5.1|
|2.1.0|2.0.0, 2.0.1|
|2.0.1|2.0.0, 2.0.1|
|2.0.0|2.0.0, 2.0.1|

JAR packages are available in two ways: [compile them yourself](../ex-ug-compile.md) or download them from the Maven repository.

If you are using NebulaGraph 1.x, use [Nebula Exchange 1.x](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/tree/v1.0/tools "Click to go to GitHub").

## Environment

Exchange 2.x supports the following operating systems:

- CentOS 7

# Import data from JSON files

This topic provides an example of how to use Exchange to import Nebula Graph data stored in HDFS or local JSON files.

## Data set

This topic takes the [basketballplayer dataset](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/dataset/dataset.zip) as an example. Some sample data are as follows:

- player

  ```json
  {"id":"player100","age":42,"name":"Tim Duncan"}
  {"id":"player101","age":36,"name":"Tony Parker"}
  {"id":"player102","age":33,"name":"LaMarcus Aldridge"}
  {"id":"player103","age":32,"name":"Rudy Gay"}
  ...
  ```

- team

  ```json
  {"id":"team200","name":"Warriors"}
  {"id":"team201","name":"Nuggets"}
  ...
  ```

- follow

  ```json
  {"src":"player100","dst":"player101","degree":95}
  {"src":"player101","dst":"player102","degree":90}
  ...
  ```

- serve

  ```json
  {"src":"player100","dst":"team204","start_year":"1997","end_year":"2016"}
  {"src":"player101","dst":"team204","start_year":"1999","end_year":"2018"}
  ...
  ```

## Environment

This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information:

- Hardware specifications:
  - CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
  - Memory: 16 GB

- Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone

- Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment

- Nebula Graph: {{nebula.release}}. [Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose](../../4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/3.deploy-nebula-graph-with-docker-compose.md).

## Prerequisites

Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information:

- Nebula Graph has been [installed](../../4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/2.install-nebula-graph-by-rpm-or-deb.md) and deployed with the following information:

  - IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services.

  - The user name and password with write permission to Nebula Graph.

- Exchange has been [compiled](../ex-ug-compile.md), or [download](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vesoft/nebula-exchange/) the compiled `.jar` file directly.

- Spark has been installed.

- Learn about the Schema created in Nebula Graph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more.

- If files are stored in HDFS, ensure that the Hadoop service is running properly.

- If files are stored locally and Nebula Graph is a cluster architecture, you need to place the files in the same directory locally on each machine in the cluster.

## Steps

### Step 1: Create the Schema in Nebula Graph

Analyze the data to create a Schema in Nebula Graph by following these steps:

1. Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the Nebula Graph are shown in the following table.

    | Element  | Name | Property |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | Tag | `player` | `name string, age int` |
    | Tag | `team` | `name string` |
    | Edge Type | `follow` | `degree int` |
    | Edge Type | `serve` | `start_year int, end_year int` |

2. Create a graph space **basketballplayer** in the Nebula Graph and create a Schema as shown below.

    ```ngql
    ## Create a graph space.
    nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \
            (partition_num = 10, \
            replica_factor = 1, \
            vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30));
    
    ## Use the graph space basketballplayer.
    nebula> USE basketballplayer;
    
    ## Create the Tag player.
    nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int);
    
    ## Create the Tag team.
    nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string);
    
    ## Create the Edge type follow.
    nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int);

    ## Create the Edge type serve.
    nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int);
    ```

For more information, see [Quick start workflow](../../2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow.md).

### Step 2: Process JSON files

Confirm the following information:

1. Process JSON files to meet Schema requirements.

2. Obtain the JSON file storage path.

### Step 3: Modify configuration files

After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file `target/classes/application.conf` to set JSON data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called `json_application.conf`. For details on each configuration item, see [Parameters in the configuration file](../parameter-reference/ex-ug-parameter.md).

```conf
{
  # Spark configuration

    app: {
      name: Nebula Exchange {{exchange.release}}

      max: 16
    }
  }

}
```

### Step 4: Import data into Nebula Graph

Run the following command to import JSON data into Nebula Graph. For a description of the parameters, see [Options for import](../parameter-reference/ex-ug-para-import-command.md).

```bash
${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit --master "local" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange <nebula-exchange-{{exchange.release}}.jar_path> -c <json_application.conf_path> 
```

!!! note

    JAR packages are available in two ways: [compiled them yourself](../ex-ug-compile.md), or [download](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vesoft/nebula-exchange/) the compiled `.jar` file directly.

For example:

```bash
${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit  --master "local" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange  /root/nebula-echange/nebula-exchange/target/nebula-exchange-{{exchange.release}}.jar  -c /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/classes/json_application.conf
```

You can search for `batchSuccess.<tag_name/edge_name>` in the command output to check the number of successes. For example, `batchSuccess.follow: 300`.

### Step 5: (optional) Validate data

Users can verify that data has been imported by executing a query in the Nebula Graph client (for example, Nebula Graph Studio). For example:

```ngql
GO FROM "player100" OVER follow;
```

Users can also run the [`SHOW STATS`](../../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/6.show/14.show-stats.md) command to view statistics.

### Step 6: (optional) Rebuild indexes in Nebula Graph

With the data imported, users can recreate and rebuild indexes in Nebula Graph. For details, see [Index overview](../../3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/README.md).

# Import data from Hive

This topic provides an example of how to use Exchange to import NebulaGraph data stored in Hive.

## Data set

This topic takes the [basketballplayer dataset](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/dataset/dataset.zip) as an example.

In this example, the data set has been stored in Hive. All vertexes and edges are stored in the `player`, `team`, `follow`, and `serve` tables. The following are some of the data for each table.

```sql
scala> spark.sql("describe basketball.player").show
+--------+---------+-------+
|col_name|data_type|comment|
+--------+---------+-------+
|playerid|   string|   null|
|     age|   bigint|   null|
|    name|   string|   null|
+--------+---------+-------+

scala> spark.sql("describe basketball.team").show
+----------+---------+-------+
|  col_name|data_type|comment|
+----------+---------+-------+
|    teamid|   string|   null|
|      name|   string|   null|
+----------+---------+-------+

scala> spark.sql("describe basketball.follow").show
+----------+---------+-------+
|  col_name|data_type|comment|
+----------+---------+-------+
|src_player|   string|   null|
|dst_player|   string|   null|
|    degree|   bigint|   null|
+----------+---------+-------+

scala> spark.sql("describe basketball.serve").show
+----------+---------+-------+
|  col_name|data_type|comment|
+----------+---------+-------+
|  playerid|   string|   null|
|    teamid|   string|   null|
|start_year|   bigint|   null|
|  end_year|   bigint|   null|
+----------+---------+-------+
```

!!! note

    The Hive data type `bigint` corresponds to the NebulaGraph `int`.

## Environment

This example is done on MacOS. Here is the environment configuration information:

- Hardware specifications:
  - CPU: 1.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
  - Memory: 16 GB

- Spark: 2.4.7, stand-alone

- Hadoop: 2.9.2, pseudo-distributed deployment

- Hive: 2.3.7, Hive Metastore database is MySQL 8.0.22

- NebulaGraph: {{nebula.release}}. [Deploy NebulaGraph with Docker Compose](../../4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/3.deploy-nebula-graph-with-docker-compose.md).

## Prerequisites

Before importing data, you need to confirm the following information:

- NebulaGraph has been [installed](../../4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/2.install-nebula-graph-by-rpm-or-deb.md) and deployed with the following information:

  - IP addresses and ports of Graph and Meta services.

  - The user name and password with write permission to NebulaGraph.

- Exchange has been [compiled](../ex-ug-compile.md), or [download](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vesoft/nebula-exchange/) the compiled `.jar` file directly.

- Spark has been installed.

- Learn about the Schema created in NebulaGraph, including names and properties of Tags and Edge types, and more.

- Hadoop has been installed and started, and the Hive Metastore database (MySQL in this example) has been started.

## Steps

### Step 1: Create the Schema in NebulaGraph

Analyze the data to create a Schema in NebulaGraph by following these steps:

1. Identify the Schema elements. The Schema elements in the NebulaGraph are shown in the following table.

    | Element   | Name     | Property                       |
    | :---      | :---     | :---                           |
    | Tag       | `player` | `name string, age int`         |
    | Tag       | `team`   | `name string`                  |
    | Edge Type | `follow` | `degree int`                   |
    | Edge Type | `serve`  | `start_year int, end_year int` |

2. Create a graph space **basketballplayer** in the NebulaGraph and create a Schema as shown below.

    ```ngql
    ## Create a graph space
    nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer \
            (partition_num = 10, \
            replica_factor = 1, \
            vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30));

    ## Use the graph space basketballplayer
    nebula> USE basketballplayer;

    ## Create the Tag player
    nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int);

    ## Create the Tag team
    nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string);

    ## Create the Edge type follow
    nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int);

    ## Create the Edge type serve
    nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int);
    ```

For more information, see [Quick start workflow](../../2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow.md).

### Step 2: Use Spark SQL to confirm Hive SQL statements

After the Spark-shell environment is started, run the following statements to ensure that Spark can read data in Hive.

```sql
scala> sql("select playerid, age, name from basketball.player").show
scala> sql("select teamid, name from basketball.team").show
scala> sql("select src_player, dst_player, degree from basketball.follow").show
scala> sql("select playerid, teamid, start_year, end_year from basketball.serve").show
```

The following is the result read from the table `basketball.player`.

```mysql
+---------+----+-----------------+
| playerid| age|             name|
+---------+----+-----------------+
|player100|  42|       Tim Duncan|
|player101|  36|      Tony Parker|
|player102|  33|LaMarcus Aldridge|
|player103|  32|         Rudy Gay|
|player104|  32|  Marco Belinelli|
+---------+----+-----------------+
...
```

### Step 3: Modify configuration file

After Exchange is compiled, copy the conf file `target/classes/application.conf` to set Hive data source configuration. In this example, the copied file is called `hive_application.conf`. For details on each configuration item, see [Parameters in the configuration file](../parameter-reference/ex-ug-parameter.md).

```conf
{
  # Spark configuration
  spark: {
    app: {
      name: Nebula Exchange {{exchange.release}}
    }
    driver: {
      cores: 1
      maxResultSize: 1G
    }
    cores: {
      max: 16
    }
  }

  # If Spark and Hive are deployed in different clusters, you need to configure the parameters for connecting to Hive. Otherwise, skip these configurations.
  #hive: {
  #  waredir: "hdfs://NAMENODE_IP:9000/apps/svr/hive-xxx/warehouse/"

      # Specify the column names in the player table in fields, and their corresponding values are specified as properties in the NebulaGraph.
      # The sequence of fields and nebula.fields must correspond to each other.
      # If multiple column names need to be specified, separate them by commas.
      fields: [age,name]
      nebula.fields: [age,name]

      # Specify a column of data in the table as the source of vertex VID in the NebulaGraph.
      vertex:{
        field:playerid
      }

      # The number of data written to NebulaGraph in a single batch.
      batch: 256

      # The number of Spark partitions.
      partition: 32
    }
    # Set the information about the Tag Team.
    {
      name: team
      type: {
        source: hive
        sink: client
      }
      exec: "select teamid, name from basketball.team"
      fields: [name]
      nebula.fields: [name]
      vertex: {
        field: teamid

    }

  ]

  # Processing edges
  edges: [
    # Set the information about the Edge Type follow.
    {
      # The corresponding Edge Type name in NebulaGraph.
      name: follow

      type: {
        # Specify the data source file format to Hive.
        source: hive

        # Specify how to import the Edge type data into NebulaGraph.
        # Specify how to import the data into NebulaGraph: Client or SST.
        sink: client
      }

      # Set the SQL statement to read the data of follow table in the basketball database.
      exec: "select src_player, dst_player, degree from basketball.follow"

      # Specify the column names in the follow table in Fields, and their corresponding values are specified as properties in the NebulaGraph.
      # The sequence of fields and nebula.fields must correspond to each other.
      # If multiple column names need to be specified, separate them by commas.
      fields: [degree]
      nebula.fields: [degree]

      # In source, use a column in the follow table as the source of the edge's starting vertex.
      # In target, use a column in the follow table as the source of the edge's destination vertex.
      source: {
        field: src_player
      }

      target: {
        field: dst_player
      }

      # (Optional) Specify a column as the source of the rank.
      #ranking: rank

      # The number of data written to NebulaGraph in a single batch.
      batch: 256

      # The number of Spark partitions.
      partition: 32
    }

    # Set the information about the Edge Type serve.
    {
      name: serve
      type: {
        source: hive
        sink: client
      }
      exec: "select playerid, teamid, start_year, end_year from basketball.serve"
      fields: [start_year,end_year]
      nebula.fields: [start_year,end_year]
      source: {
        field: playerid
      }
      target: {
        field: teamid
      }

      # (Optional) Specify a column as the source of the rank.
      #ranking: rank

      batch: 256
      partition: 32
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Import data into NebulaGraph

Run the following command to import Hive data into NebulaGraph. For a description of the parameters, see [Options for import](../parameter-reference/ex-ug-para-import-command.md).

```bash
${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit --master "local" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange <nebula-exchange-{{exchange.release}}.jar_path> -c <hive_application.conf_path> -h
```

!!! note

    JAR packages are available in two ways: [compiled them yourself](../ex-ug-compile.md), or [download](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vesoft/nebula-exchange/) the compiled `.jar` file directly.

For example:

```bash
${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit  --master "local" --class com.vesoft.nebula.exchange.Exchange  /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/nebula-exchange-{{exchange.release}}.jar  -c /root/nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange/target/classes/hive_application.conf -h
```

You can search for `batchSuccess.<tag_name/edge_name>` in the command output to check the number of successes. For example, `batchSuccess.follow: 300`.

### Step 5: (optional) Validate data

Users can verify that data has been imported by executing a query in the NebulaGraph client (for example, NebulaGraph Studio). For example:

```ngql
GO FROM "player100" OVER follow;
```

Users can also run the [SHOW STATS](../../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/6.show/14.show-stats.md) command to view statistics.

### Step 6: (optional) Rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph

With the data imported, users can recreate and rebuild indexes in NebulaGraph. For details, see [Index overview](../../3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/README.md).

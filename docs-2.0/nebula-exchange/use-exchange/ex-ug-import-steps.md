# Use Exchange

This article introduces the generally-used procedure on how to use Exchange to import data from a specified source to Nebula Graph.

## Prerequisites

To import data with Exchange, do a check of these:

- Nebula Graph is deployed and started. Get the information:
  - IP addresses and ports of the Graph Service and the Meta Service.
  - A Nebula Graph account with the privilege of writing data and its password.

- Exchange is compiled. For more information, see [Compile Exchange](../ex-ug-compile.md).

- Spark is installed.

- Get the necessary information for schema creation in Nebula Graph, including tags and edge types.

## Procedure

To import data from a source to Nebula Graph, follow these steps:

1. Create a graph space and a schema in Nebula Graph.

2. (Optional) Process the source data. For example, to import data from a Neo4j database, create indexes for the specified tags in Neo4j to export the data from Neo4j more quickly.

3. Edit the configuration file for Spark, Nebula Graph, vertices, and edges.
   > **NOTE**: After compiling of Exchange, refer to the example configuration files in the `nebula-exchange/target/classes` directory for the configuration for different sources.

4. (Optional) Run the import command with the `-D` parameter to verify the configuration. For more information, see [Import command parameters](../parameter-reference/ex-ug-para-import-command.md).

5. Run the import command to import data into Nebula Graph.

6. Verify the imported data in Nebula Graph.

7. (Optional) Create and rebuild indexes in Nebula Graph.

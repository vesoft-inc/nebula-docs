!!! enterpriseonly

    You can get Exchange Enterprise Edition in NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition Package only.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

<!-- The Maven library where Pulsar is located was officially closed on May 31st, and the migration location has not been found yet. You can delete it once you find it-->
- Download [pulsar-spark-connector_2.11](https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/jar-packages/pulsar-spark-connector_2.11.zip), and unzip it to `io/streamnative/connectors` directory of the local Maven library.

## Steps

1. Clone the repository `nebula-exchange` in the `/` directory.

   ```bash
   git clone -b {{exchange.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-exchange.git
   ```

2. Switch to the directory `nebula-exchange`.

   ```bash
   cd nebula-exchange/nebula-exchange
   ```

3. Package Nebula Exchange.

   ```bash
   mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dgpg.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
   ```

After the compilation is successful, you can view a directory structure similar to the following in the current directory.

```text
.
├── README-CN.md
├── README.md
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   ├── main
│   └── test
└── target
    ├── classes
    ├── classes.timestamp
    ├── maven-archiver
    ├── nebula-exchange-2.x.y-javadoc.jar
    ├── nebula-exchange-2.x.y-sources.jar
    ├── nebula-exchange-2.x.y.jar
    ├── original-nebula-exchange-2.x.y.jar
    └── site
```

In the `target` directory, users can find the `exchange-2.x.y.jar` file.

!!! note

    The JAR file version changes with the release of the Nebula Java Client. Users can view the latest version on the [Releases page](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-java/releases).

When migrating data, you can refer to configuration file [`target/classes/application.conf`](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-exchange/blob/master/nebula-exchange_spark_2.4/src/main/resources/application.conf).

### Failed to download the dependency package

If downloading dependencies fails when compiling:

- Check the network settings and ensure that the network is normal.

- Modify the `mirror` part of Maven installation directory `libexec/conf/settings.xml`:

  ```text
  <mirror>
   <id>alimaven</id>
   <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
   <name>aliyun maven</name>
   <url>http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/repositories/central/</url>
  </mirror>
  ```

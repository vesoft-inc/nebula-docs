# How to Contribute

## Before you get started

### File an issue on the github or forum

You are welcome to contribute any code or files to the project. But first we suggest you raise an issue on the [github](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph) or on the [forum](https://discuss.nebula-graph.io/)
 to start a discussion with the community. Check through the topic for Github.

### Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

What is [CLA](https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html)?

Here is the [vesoft inc. Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/vesoft-inc/).

Click the **Sign in with Github to agree** button to sign the CLA.

If you have any question, send an email to `info@vesoft.com`.

## Step 1: Fork in the github.com

The Nebula Graph project has many [repositories](https://github.com/vesoft-inc). Take [the graph engine repository](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph) for example:

1. Visit https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph
1. Click the `Fork` button (top right) to establish an online fork.

## Step 2: Clone Fork to Local Storage

Define a local working directory:

```bash
# Define your working directory
working_dir=$HOME/Workspace
```

Set `user` to match your Github profile name:

```bash
user={your Github profile name}
```

Create your clone:

```bash
mkdir -p $working_dir
cd $working_dir
git clone https://github.com/$user/nebula-graph.git
# the following is recommended
# or: git clone git@github.com:$user/nebula-graph.git

cd $working_dir/nebula
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph.git
# or: git remote add upstream git@github.com:vesoft-inc/nebula-graph.git

# Never push to upstream master since you do not have write access.
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push

# Confirm that your remotes make sense:
# It should look like:
# origin    git@github.com:$(user)/nebula-graph.git (fetch)
# origin    git@github.com:$(user)/nebula-graph.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph (fetch)
# upstream  no_push (push)
git remote -v
```

### Define a Pre-Commit Hook

Please link the **Nebula Graph** pre-commit hook into your `.git` directory.

This hook checks your commits for formatting, building, doc generation, etc.

```bash
cd $working_dir/nebula-graph/.git/hooks
ln -s $working_dir/nebula-graph/.linters/cpp/hooks/pre-commit.sh .
```

Sometimes, pre-commit hook can not be executable. You have to make it executable manually.

```bash
cd $working_dir/nebula-graph/.git/hooks
chmod +x pre-commit
```

## Step 3: Branch

Get your local master up to date:

```bash
cd $working_dir/nebula-graph
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
```

Checkout a new branch from master:

```bash
git checkout -b myfeature
```

**NOTE**: Because your PR often consists of several commits, which might be squashed while being merged into upstream,
we strongly suggest you open a separate topic branch to make your changes on. After merged,
this topic branch could be just abandoned, thus you could synchronize your master branch with
upstream easily with a rebase like above. Otherwise, if you commit your changes directly into master,
maybe you must use a hard reset on the master branch, like:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git reset --hard upstream/master
git push --force origin master
```

### Step 4: Develop

#### Code Style

We adopt `cpplint` to make sure that the project conforms to Google's coding style guides. The checker will be implemented before the code is committed.

#### Unit Tests Required

Please add unit tests for your new features or bug fixes.

#### Build Your Code with Unit Tests Enable

Please refer to the [build source code](../4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/1.install-nebula-graph-by-compiling-the-source-code.md) documentation to compile.

> Make sure you have enabled the build of unit tests by setting `-DENABLE_TESTING=ON`.

#### Run Tests

In the root folder of `nebula-graph` , run the following command:

```bash
ctest -j$(nproc)
```

### Step 5: Bring Your Branch Update to Date

```bash
# While on your myfeature branch.
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

You need to bring the head branch up to date after other collaborators merge pull requests to the base branch.

### Step 6: Commit

Commit your changes.

```bash
git commit -a
```

Likely you'll go back and edit/build/test some more than `--amend` in a few cycles.

### Step 7: Push

When ready to review (or just to establish an offsite backup or your work),
push your branch to your fork on `github.com`:

```bash
git push origin myfeature
```

### Step 8: Create a Pull Request

1. Visit your fork at https://github.com/$user/nebula-graph (replace `$user` obviously).
2. Click the `Compare & pull request` button next to your `myfeature` branch.

### Step 9: Get a Code Review

Once your pull request has been opened, it will be assigned to at least two
reviewers. Those reviewers will do a thorough code review to make sure that the changes meet the repository's contributing guidelines and other quality standards.

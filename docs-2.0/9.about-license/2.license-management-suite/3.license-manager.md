# License Manager

A License Manager (LM) is an essential service that runs on a server for you to manage your license and to license the NebulaGraph enterprise edition database and its associated software. You can use an LM client that communicates with the LM service to load [license keys](2.license-center.md) and view license information, including the license validity period and purchased nodes. By configuring the LM service address in the NebulaGraph database and its associated software, the validity of the license can be verified to ensure the normal use of the NebulaGraph database and its associated software.

This article introduces how to deploy and use an LM service, as well as how to configure it within the Nebula Graph database and its associated software.

## Preparations

- [You have purchased a Vesoft license](../3.purchase-license.md).
- You have obtained the desired LM installation package.
  
  !!! note

        LM installation packages are sent to you by email after you purchase a license.

## Notes

An LM is a single-process service. To ensure the reliability and continuity of the LM, it is recommended that you use systemd to manage the LM and set a restart policy for the LM.

## Install and start LM

An LM can be installed on Linux amd64 or arm64 systems or installed through Dashboard.

### Using the TAR Package 

1. Unpack the LM TAR package.

  ```bash
  tar -zxvf <name.tar.gz> -C <path>
  ```

  - `<name.tar.gz>`: The name of the LM TAR package.
  - `<path>`: The installation path for the unpacked LM. If the `-C` parameter is not specified, it defaults to the current directory.
  
2. Start the LM service using systemd.

  1. Create the LM service file `/etc/systemd/system/yueshu-license-manager.service` with the following contents:

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=License Manager
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=<path>/yueshu-license-manager/yueshu-license-manager
    WorkingDirectory=<path>/yueshu-license-manager
    Restart=always
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    - `<path>`: Refers to the directory where the LM package is extracted.

  2. Start the LM service:

    ```
    sudo systemctl start yueshu-license-manager
    ```

3. Set up LM to start automatically on boot.

  ```
  sudo systemctl enable yueshu-license-manager
  ```

### Using the RPM package

1. Unpack the LM RPM package.

  ```bash
  sudo rpm -ivh <name.rpm>
  ```

  - `<name.rpm>`: The name of the LM RPM package.
  - The default installation path is `/usr/local/nebula-license-manager`, which cannot be changed.

2. Start LM.

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start nebula-license-manager
  ```

3. Set up LM to start automatically on boot.

  ```
  sudo systemctl enable yueshu-license-manager
  ```

### Using the DEB package 

1. Unpack the LM DEB package.

  ```bash
  sudo dpkg -i <name.deb>
  ```

  - `<name.deb>`: The name of the LM DEB package.
  - The default installation path is `/usr/local/nebula-license-manager`, which cannot be changed.
  
2. Start LM.

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start nebula-license-manager
  ```

3. Set up LM to start automatically on boot.

  ```
  sudo systemctl enable yueshu-license-manager
  ```

### Using Dashboard

LM can be installed and started through Dashboard. For more information, see [Connect to Dashboard](../../nebula-dashboard-ent/3.connect-dashboard.md).

## Use LM

After your LM starts, in the LM installation path you can use the LM CLI to view license information.

### View LM CLI version

```bash
./nebula-license-manager-cli version
```

!!! note

    When LM starts, its version information is printed in the logs.

### Load a license key

After [generating a license key](2.license-center.md#bind-lmid-to-generate-a-license-key), you need to use the LM client tool to load the license key.

```bash
./nebula-license-manager-cli load --key <license-key> --force
```

- `<license-key>`: The license key string, such as `MSY2-LGQ6O-69521-XXXXX-XXXXX`.
- `--force`: Loads the license key without checking the current license status. This flag is optional.

### View license information

```bash
./nebula-license-manager-cli info
```

- When the license key is not loaded, the output is as follows:

  ```
            LMID:  RUZB-XXXX                     
   LicenseStatus:  NotExist
  ``` 

- When the license key is loaded, the output is as follows:
  
  ```
            LMID:  RUZB-XXXX                    
   LicenseStatus:  Normal                      
      LicenseKey:  MM90U-9H4Q0-W093M-XXXXX-XXXXX 
            Type:  NODE                          
      Query Node:  3                             
    Storage Node:  3                             
        ExpireAt:  2023-06-25 12:00:00 +0800 CST 
  ```

The information items of the license in the output are described as follows:

| Items | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `LMID` | The ID of your LM. When you obtain a license key, this LMID needs to be bound. For more information, see [Generate a license key](2.license-center.md#bind-lmid-to-generate-a-license-key).|
| `LicenseStatus` | The status of the license. It includes:<br/>`Normal`: The license can be used normally.<br/>`NotExist`: The license key does not exist.<br/>`Invalid`: The license key is invalid.<br/>`Syncing`: Synchronizing the license information from [LC](2.license-center.md).<br/>`Expiring`: The license is about to expire.<br/>`Expired`: The license has expired.|
| `LicenseKey` | An encrypted string containing authorization information, which is the only credential for you to obtain the authorization of the NebulaGraph database and its associated software. For details, see [License key](2.license-center.md). |
| `Type` | The type of resources purchased. Currently, only node-based resources can be purchased.|
| `Query Node` | The number of query nodes purchased|
| `Storage Node` | The number of storage nodes purchased|
| `ExpireAt` | The expiration time of the license. |

### Synchronize license info

When the license key loaded into LM is in online mode, the LM periodically synchronizes the license information from LC every 1 to 2 hours. You can also manually synchronize the license key using the following command.

```bash
./nebula-license-manager-cli sync
```

### Check the license quota usage

You can run the following command to check the current usage of the license quota (the number of nodes purchased) and the usage status of the associated software.

```bash
./nebula-license-manager-cli usage
```

### View the license information on a specified LM

For a database administrator (DBA), there may be a need to view the license information on a specified LM. To achieve this, run the following command:

```bash
./nebula-license-manager-cli <command> --addr <host>:9119
```

- `<command>`: The command to be executed. Options include `info`, `usage`, `sync`, and `load --key <license-key> --force`.
- `<host>`: The IP address of the host where the specified LM is located.


## Configure LM 

### Configure LM in NebulaGraph

In the NebulaGraph database Meta service configuration file (`nebula-metad.conf`), set the `license_manager_url` value to reflect the IP address of the LM host and port number `9119` in the format like `192.168.8.xxx:9119`. For more information, see [Meta service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md).

After the configuration is complete, [restart the Meta service](../../2.quick-start/5.start-stop-service.md). 

### Configure LM in Explorer

In the Explorer installation directory, enter the `config` folder and modify the `app-config.yaml` file. Set the value of `LicenseManagerURL` to reflect the IP address of the LM host and port number `9119` in the format like `192.168.8.xxx:9119`.

After the configuration is complete, restart Explorer. For more information, see [Deploy Explorer](../../nebula-explorer/deploy-connect/ex-ug-deploy.md).

### Configure LM in Dashboard

In the Dashboard installation directory, enter the `etc` folder and modify the `config.yaml` file. Set the value of `LicenseManagerURL` to reflect the IP address of the LM host and port number `9119` in the format like `192.168.8.xxx:9119`.

After the configuration is complete, restart Dashboard. For more information, see [Deploy Dashboard](../../nebula-dashboard-ent/2.deploy-connect-dashboard-ent.md).

### Configure LM in Analytics

In the Analytics installation directory, enter the `scripts` folder and modify the `analytics.conf` file. Set the value of `license_manager_url` to the IP address of the LM host and the port number `9119`, for example, `192.168.8.xxx:9119`.

After the configuration is complete, run `./run_pagerank.sh` in the `scripts` folder to start the Analytics service. For more information, see [NebulaGraph Analytics](../../graph-computing/nebula-analytics.md).


## FAQ

Q: Can I change the host on which my LM is located?
A: No. The LM is bound to the host where it is installed. If you need to change the host, or the host is unable to be used, you need to [contact Vesoft sales](https://www.nebula-graph.io/contact) to rebind the LMID.

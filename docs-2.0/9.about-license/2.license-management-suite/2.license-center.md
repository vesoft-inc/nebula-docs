# License Center

License Center (LC) provided by Vesoft is an online platform for managing licenses that is accessible through public networks. On the LC platform, you can track all your purchased license information, including details such as license type, number of purchased resources, the status of the license, and expiration date. 

On LC, you can bind an [LMID](3.license-manager.md) to generate a license key. The license key must then be loaded into the installed LM service. And after specifying the LM access address in the software, you can authorize the license which enables you to use the software NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.

This article introduces the setup, homepage, license details page of LC, and how to bind an LMID on LC.

## LC homepage

The LC homepage displays the entrance to the cloud marketplace where licenses can be purchased, as well as lists of purchased licenses.

The **LICENSES LIST** section displays the information of all purchased licenses, including LMID (displayed as blank if LMID is not bound) and expiration date. If no licenses have been purchased, the list will be empty.

## License details

In the **LICENSES LIST** section of the LC homepage, click **VIEW DETAILS** to access the license details page. 

### Basic information

- **LMID**ï¼šIndicates the ID of the [LM](3.license-manager.md) service that you installed (If not bound, this field will be empty).
- **License Type**: Currently limited to the purchase of node-based resources.
- **Start At** and **Expire Time**: Indicates the active and expiry dates of the license.

### Purchased resources

In the **Purchased Resources** section, you can view the purchased query and storage node quantities and statuses, as well as the complimentary software names and statuses.

### License key

A license key is an encrypted string containing authorization information and serves as the unique credential for you to obtain access to the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition database and its associated software features. There are two forms of License keys: online license keys and offline license keys.

- Online license keys
  
  An online license allows you to obtain the latest license information from LC. 

  When binding your LMID, select the **Online** mode to generate an online license key. After you enter the online key into the LM service, the LM can retrieve the latest license information regularly.

- Offline license keys
  
  Compared to an online license key, an offline license key contains fixed license information. If the license information is updated, a new offline license key must be obtained.

  When binding your LMID, select the **Offline** mode to generate an offline license key. After you enter the offline license key into your LM, the LM service stores fixed license information. 

!!! note 

    You can choose a license key type based on your LM accessibility. 

    - If your LM is accessible from the internet, you can select either **Online** or **Offline** mode. The **Online** mode is recommended, as it generates an online license key.
    - If your LM is not accessible from the internet, then **Offline** mode is the only option available for generating an offline license key, as it can't reach out to the license server to validate the key itself.

For information about how to bind the ID of your LM, see the following section **Bind LMID**.

### Subscriptions

This section displays the subscription ID of the cloud marketplace where your license is purchased, your subscription platform account, product ID, and subscription details.

## Bind LMID

1. On the targeted license details page, click **Bind License Manager ID**.
2. In the pop-up panel, enter the ID of your LM. For how to view LMID, see [LM](3.license-manager.md).
3. Select **Online** or **Offline**, and then click **CONFIRM** to bind the LMID.
   
  - Select **Online** to generate an online license key, so that LM can get the latest license information from LC every 1 ~ 2 hours.
  
  - Select **Offline** to generate an offline license key, which means LM obtains fixed license information. If you need to update the license information, you must obtain a new offline license key.

!!! caution

    Each license can only be bound to one LMID, and the unbinding of LMIDs is not supported.

There are two forms of License keys: online license keys and offline license keys.

- Online license keys
  When binding your LMID, select the **Online** mode to generate an online license key. After you enter the key into your LM, the LM can retrieve the latest license information from LC every 1-2 hours.

- Offline license keys
  When binding your LMID, select the **Offline** mode to generate an offline license key.  Compared to an online license key, after you enter an offline license key into your LM, the LM stores fixed license information. If the license information is updated, a new offline license key must be obtained.

To generate a license key, you need to bind the [ID of your License Manager (LM)](#bind_lmid_to_generate_a_license_key) on LC. The license key must then be loaded into the installed LM service. And after specifying the LM access address in the software, you can authorize the license which enables you to use NebulaGraph Enterprise.

## Bind LMID to generate a license key

After you log in to LC, you need bind the ID of your LM to generate a license key. 

!!! caution

    Each license can only be bound to one LMID, and the unbinding of LMIDs is not supported.

### Quickly bind LMID

You are guided to bind the [LMID](3.license-manager.md#view_license_information) every time you log in to LC after you buy a new license. Binding the LMID is a prerequisite to generate a license key for using the license. You can also skip the quick binding and [bind the LMID on the license information page](#bind_lmid_on_the_license_information_page).

The following describes how to quickly bind the LMID:

1. On the quick binding page, check the information of the purchased license, and click **Next**.
   
2. Bind the LMID by the following steps and then click **Next**.
  1. Install the LM service. For how to install the LM service, see [LM](3.license-manager.md#install_and_start_lm).
  2. View the LMID. For how to view the LMID, see [LM](3.license-manager.md#view_license_information).
  3. Fill in the LMID and select **Online** or **Offline**. 
   
    - Online 
  
      Select the **Online** mode to generate an online license key. 

    - Offline 
  
      Select the **Offline** mode to generate an offline license key. After you enter the offline license key into your LM, the LM service stores fixed license information.

    For more information, see [License key](#license_key).

  4. Click **BIND LMID** to complete the binding.

3. View the license key generated after binding the LMID and click **Close** to complete the binding.

4. (Optional) Copy the license key and load it into the LM service. For how to load the license key, see [LM](3.license-manager.md#load_a_license_key).



!!! note 

    You can choose a license key type based on your LM accessibility. 

    - If your LM is accessible from the internet, you can select either **Online** or **Offline** mode. The **Online** mode is recommended, as it generates an online license key.
    - If your LM is not accessible from the internet, then **Offline** mode is the only option available for generating an offline license key, as it can't reach out to the license server to validate the key itself.

### Bind LMID on the license information page

If you skip the quick binding, you can still bind the LMID on the license information page.

1. On the targeted license details page, click **Bind License Manager ID**.
2. In the pop-up panel, enter the ID of your LM. For how to view LMID, see [LM](3.license_manager.md).
3. Select **Online** or **Offline**, and then click **CONFIRM** to bind the LMID.
   
  - Select **Online** to generate an online license key, so that LM can get the latest license information from LC every 1 ~ 2 hours.
  
  - Select **Offline** to generate an offline license key, which means LM obtains fixed license information. If you need to update the license information, you must obtain a new offline license key.

4. In the **License Key** section, view the license key generated after binding the LMID.
5. (Optional) Copy the license key and load it into the LM service. For how to load the license key, see [LM](3.license-manager.md#load_a_license_key).

## License information

In the **LICENSES LIST** section of the LC homepage, click **VIEW DETAILS** to access the **License Info** page. 

### Basic information

- **LMID**：Indicates the ID of the [LM](3.license-manager.md) service that you installed (If not bound, this field will be empty).
- **License Type**: Currently limited to the purchase of node-based resources.
- **Start At** and **Expire Time**: Indicates the active and expiry dates of the license.

### Resources

In the **Purchased Resources** section, you can view the purchased query and storage node quantities and statuses, as well as the complimentary software names and statuses.

### License key

After you bind the LMID, a license key is automatically generated and the **License Key** section displays the license key information.

- Online license keys

  An online license allows you to obtain the latest license information from LC. 

  When binding your LMID, select the **Online** mode to generate an online license key. After you [load the key into the LM service](3.license-manager.md#load_a_license_key), the LM can retrieve the latest license information regularly.

- Offline license keys

  Compared to an online license key, an offline license key contains fixed license information. If the license information is updated, a new offline license key must be obtained.

  When binding your LMID, select the **Offline** mode to generate an offline license key. Compared to an online license key, after you [load an offline license key into your LM](3.license-manager.md#load_a_license_key), the LM service stores fixed license information. If the license information is updated, a new offline license key must be obtained.

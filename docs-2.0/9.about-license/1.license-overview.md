# About Vesoft licenses

## What Vesoft licenses do

Vesoft licenses refer to the legal permission granted by Vesoft Co., Ltd., which allows you to utilize the capabilities of the Vesoft graph database (NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition) and its associated software. You can buy a Vesoft license on a cloud marketplace or by contacting Vesoft's sales team. Currently, the available cloud marketplace is AWS Marketplace. You can buy a Vesoft license on [NebulaGraph Enterprise (by Node)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-kvpxjh5b4dfno) on AWS Marketplace.

After purchasing a Vesoft license, you need to obtain a license key by [binding a LMID through LC](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md). Once the [License Key](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md) is obtained, you need to use the [LM](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md) service deployed to load the license key. When starting Vesoft's graph database and associated software, the LM service will check the validity of the license. If the license is valid, the graph database and associated software will function normally. Otherwise, the graph database and associated software will not be functional.

You can view the license information, including the expiration date, nodes purchased, and license key on [LC](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md) or by using the [LM](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md) client to query the license information in the command line.

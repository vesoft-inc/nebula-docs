    NebulaGraph licenses applies only to the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.

## What NebulaGraph licenses do

NebulaGraph licenses are the legal permissions granted by Vesoft Co., Ltd., allowing you to utilize the capabilities of a NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition database and its associated software. You can buy a NebulaGraph license on a cloud marketplace or by contacting Vesoft's sales team. Currently, the only cloud marketplace available is the AWS Marketplace. You can purchase a NebulaGraph license from [NebulaGraph Enterprise (by Node)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-kvpxjh5b4dfno) on the AWS Marketplace.

After purchasing a NebulaGraph license, you must obtain a [license key](#license-key) by [binding an LMID through the LC](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md). Once the license key is obtained, you need to use the [LM](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md) service to load the license key. When starting the NebulaGraph Enterprise and associated software, the LM service will check the validity of the license. If the license is valid, then the graph database and associated software will function normally. Otherwise, the graph database and associated software will not be functional.

You can view the license information, including the expiration date, nodes purchased, and license key on the [LC](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md) or by using the [LM](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md) client to query the license information via the command line.

## License key

A license key is an encrypted string containing authorization information and serves as the unique credential for you to obtain access to the NebulaGraph Enterprise and its associated software features. There are two forms of license keys: online license keys and offline license keys. For more information, see [License key](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md#license-key).

## Renew licenses

- For licenses purchased through Vesoft's sales staff, you need to contact the sales staff to renew.
- For licenses purchased on the cloud marketplace platform, the renewal operation is as follows:
  1. In the **LICENSES LIST** section of the LC homepage, find the target license card.
  2. Click **RENEW** to enter the cloud marketplace renewal page.
  3. Click **Modify renewal terms** and select the renewal period, which can be 1 month or 1 year.
  4. Click **Modify renewal**.

  After a successful renewal, if the license key loaded in the LM is online, your LM will automatically synchronize the license information. If it is offline, you need to re-copy the new offline license key on LC, and then reload the new offline license key into your LM.

## Expand license node count

- For licenses purchased through sales staff, you need to contact the sales staff to increase the number of nodes.
- For licenses purchased on the cloud marketplace platform, the renewal operation is as follows:
  1. In the **LICENSES LIST** section of the LC homepage, find the target license card.
  2. Click **RENEW** to enter the cloud marketplace renewal page.
  3. Click **Upgrade current contract** and select the number of nodes to be added.
  4. Click **Modify current contract**.

  After the node expansion is successful, if the license key loaded in the LM is online, the LM will automatically synchronize the license information. If it is an offline license key, you need to re-copy the new offline license key on LC, and then reload the new offline license key into LM.

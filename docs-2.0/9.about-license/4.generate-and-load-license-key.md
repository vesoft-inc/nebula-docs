# Generate and load license keys

After purchasing a license, you need to generate a [license key](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md) and then load it into the [LM](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md). After that, NebulaGraph and its associated software check the validity of the license key through LM at startup. If the license key is valid, the NebulaGraph database and associated software can be used normally. This article introduces how to generate and load a license key.

## Preparations

- [You have purchased a license](3.purchase-license.md)
- [You have registered an LC account and logged in](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md)
- [You have installed LM](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md)

## Generate a license key

1. [Go to LC](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md).
2. In the **LICENSE LIST** section, click the target license card.
3. On the **License Info** page, find the **Basic Info** section, and click **Bind License Manager ID**.
4. Bind the ID of your LM. For details, see [Bind LMID](2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md).

  !!! note 

        You can choose a license key type based on your LM deployment environment. 

      - If your LM is deployed on a public network, both **Online** and **Offline** modes can be selected. **Online** mode is recommended, which generates an online license key.
      - If your LM is deployed on a private network, select the **Offline** mode, which generates an offline license key.
  
5. In the **License Key** section, you can see the corresponding license key information.

## Load a license key

1. Go to the directory where your LM is located (default path is `/usr/local/nebula-license-manager`).

  ```bash
  cd /usr/local/nebula-license-manager
  ```

2. Run the following command to load the license key.

  ```bash
  ./nebula-license-manager-cli license load --key <license-key>
  ```

  `<license-key>`: Specifies the license key string, such as `MSY2-LGQ6O-69521-xxx`.

3. After successfully loading the license key, run the following command to view the license information.

  ```bash
  ./nebula-license-manager-cli license info
  ```

  The license information includes license status, license key, type, validity period, number of nodes purchased. For more information, see [View license information](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md).

## Next to do

After loading the license key in LM, you need to configure the LM address in the NebulaGraph database or associated software. Only then can you use the NebulaGraph database and associated software features normally. For details, see [Configure LM](2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md).

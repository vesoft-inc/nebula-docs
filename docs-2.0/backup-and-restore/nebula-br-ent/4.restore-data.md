# Restore data with BR (Enterprise Edition)

For the backed-up NebulaGraph data with the [BR tool](2.install-tools.md), you can restore the data. This topic describes how to restore data from backup files.

## Notes

- There will be a period of NebulaGraph service unavailability for data restoration, so it is recommended to operate during the low business peak period.
- Restoration requires that the number of the storage servers in the original cluster is the same as that of the storage servers in the target cluster. 
- After the data restoration is executed successfully, the existing data on the target cluster will be deleted and then replaced with the data in the backup directory. It is recommended to back up the data on the target cluster in advance.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed [BR Enterprise Edition and Agent](2.install-tools.md), and have started the Agent(s) that are installed in each machine.

- No application is connected to the target NebulaGraph cluster.

- Make sure the number of the storage servers in the original cluster is the same as that in the target cluster.

## Steps

In the BR Enterprise Edition installation directory, follow these steps:

1. View backup files.

  - List the backup files in a local path. 
  
    ```bash
    ./br show --storage local://<storage_path>
    ```

    For example, you can view the backup files in the local `/backup/` path with the following command.

    ```bash
    ./br show --storage "local:///backup/"
    +----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------+-------------+------------+----------------------------+
    |            NAME            |     CREATE TIME     |         SPACES         | FULL BACKUP | ALL SPACES |      BASE BACKUP NAME      |
    +----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------+-------------+------------+----------------------------+
    | BACKUP_2022_08_11_06_12_43 | 2022-08-11 06:12:43 | basketballplayer       | true        | true       |                            |
    | BACKUP_2022_08_11_08_27_14 | 2022-08-11 08:27:15 | basketballplayer,br    | false       | true       | BACKUP_2022_08_11_06_12_43 |
    ```

  - Lists backups in `/` under the `nebula-br-test` bucket of the S3 protocol-compliant object storage service.

    ```bash
    ./br show --s3.access_key QImbbGDjfQEYxxxx --s3.secret_key dVSJZfl7tnoFq7Z5zt6sfYnvi63bxxxx  --s3.region us-east-1 --storage s3://nebula-br-test/ --s3.endpoint http://192.168.8.xxx:9000/
    ```

2. Restore data.
   
  - Restore data based on local backups.
  
    ```
    ./br restore full --meta <ip_address> --storage <storage_path> --name <backup_name>
    ```

    For example, restore the `BACKUP_2022_08_11_09_11_07` file data from the local `/backup/` path to the cluster with the meta address `192.168.8.129:9559`:

    ```
    ./br restore full --meta "192.168.8.129:9559" --storage "local:///backup/" --name BACKUP_2022_08_11_09_11_07
    ```
  
  - Restore data based on cloud backups.
  
    Restore the `BACKUP_2022_08_12_07_37_02` backup data from the `/` path under the `nebula-br-test` bucket of the S3-compliant object storage service to the cluster with the meta address `192.168.8.129:9559`, and specify the restoration log path.

    ```bash
    ./br restore full --meta 192.168.8.129:9559 --s3.accesskey QImbbGDjfQEYxxxx --s3.secretkey dVSJZfl7tnoFq7Z5zt6sfYnvi63bxxxx  --s3.region us-east-1 --storage s3://nebula-br-test/ --s3.endpoint http://192.168.8.xxx:9000/ --log "3.log" --name BACKUP_2022_08_12_07_37_02
    ```
    
  If the following information is returned, the data is restored successfully.

  ```bash
  Restore succeed.
  ```
  
  !!! note

        If the data restoration fails, BR Enterprise Edition automatically performs a rollback and the cluster's data is automatically recovered back to the pre-restoration data.


3. Run the following command to clean temporary files. This command will clean up temporary files in the cluster or external storage, and you can also use this command to clean up old backup directories. The example is as follows.
   
  !!! note

        By default, BR automatically cleans up the temporary files when an error occurs during data restoration. If the automatic cleanup fails, you need to execute the command to clean up the temporary files manually. 

  - Clear a local backup directory.
  
    ```
    ./br cleanup --meta 192.168.8.129:9559 --storage "local:///backup/" --name BACKUP_2022_08_11_09_11_07
    ```

  - Clear the backup directory in the cloud storage service.
  
    ```
    ./br cleanup --meta 192.168.8.129:9559 --s3.accesskey QImbbGDjfQEYxxxx --s3.secretkey dVSJZfl7tnoFq7Z5zt6sfYnvi63bxxxx  --s3.region us-east-1 --storage s3://nebula-br-test/ --s3.endpoint http://192.168.8.xxx:9000/ --name BACKUP_2022_08_12_07_37_02
    ```

## Options

The following options are for data restorations.

The format is `<schema>://<storage_path>`.<br>`schema`: Two options, `s3` and `local`.<br>When `schema` is `s3`, you still need to add options of `s3.access_key`、`s3.endpoint`、`s3.region`, and `s3.secret_key`.<br>`<storage_path>`: The storage path of the backup to be restored.|
| `--s3.access_key` | string | No | None | The Access Key ID that is used to identify a user. |

## View restoration progress

The log file `br.log` of BR can be viewed in the installation directory. The log file will record the restoration progress and will look like as follows:

```log
{"level":"info","msg":"download storaged partition finished, progress: 1/20","time":"2023-03-15T02:16:43.430Z"}
{"level":"info","msg":"download storaged partition finished, progress: 2/20","time":"2023-03-15T02:16:43.431Z"}
{"level":"info","msg":"download storaged partition finished, progress: 3/20","time":"2023-03-15T02:16:43.763Z"}
```

# Use BR to back up data

After the BR is installed, you can back up data of the entire graph space. This topic introduces how to use the BR to back up data.

## Prerequisites

To back up data with the BR, do a check of these:

- [Install BR and Agent](2.compile-br.md) and run Agent on each host in the cluster.

- The NebulaGraph services are running.

- If you store the backup files locally, create a directory with the same absolute path on the meta servers, the storage servers, and the BR machine for the backup files and get the absolute path. Make sure the account has write privileges for this directory.

  !!! note

      In the production environment, we recommend that you mount Network File System (NFS) storage to the meta servers, the storage servers, and the BR machine for local backup, or use Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS for remote backup. When you restore the data from local files, you must manually move these backup files to a specified directory, which causes redundant data and troubles. For more information, see [Restore data from backup files](4.br-restore-data.md).

## Procedure

In the BR installation directory (the default path of the compiled BR is `./bin/br`), run the following command to perform a full backup for the entire cluster.

!!! Note

    Make sure that the local path where the backup file is stored exists.

```bash
$ ./br backup full --meta <ip_address> --storage <storage_path>
```

For example: 

- Run the following command to perform a full backup for the entire cluster whose meta service address is `192.168.8.129:9559`, and save the backup file to `/home/nebula/backup/`.

  !!! caution

      - If there are multiple metad addresses, you can use any one of them.

      - If you back up data to a local disk, only the data of the leader metad is backed up by default. So if there are multiple metad processes, you need to manually copy the directory of the leader metad (path `<storage_path>/meta`) and overwrite the corresponding directory of other follower meatd processes.

  ```bash
  $ ./br backup full --meta "192.168.8.129:9559" --storage "local:///home/nebula/backup/"
  ```

- Run the following command to perform a full backup for the entire cluster whose meta service address is `192.168.8.129:9559`, and save the backup file to `backup` in the `br-test` bucket of the object storage service compatible with S3 protocol.

  ```bash
  $ ./br backup full --meta "192.168.8.129:9559" --s3.endpoint "http://192.168.8.129:9000" --storage="s3://br-test/backup/" --s3.access_key=minioadmin --s3.secret_key=minioadmin --s3.region=default
  ```

The parameters are as follows.

| Parameter    | Data type | Required | Default value | Description                                                                 |
| ---          | ---      | ---           | ---                                                                         | ---       |
| `-h,-help`     | -         | No       | None          | Checks help for restoration.                                                |
| `--debug` | - | No | None | Checks for more log information. |
| `--log`        | string    | No       | `"br.log"`        | Specifies detailed log path for restoration and backup. |
| `--meta`        | string    | Yes       | None        | The IP address and port of the meta service. |
| `--space`        | string    | Yes       | None        | (Experimental feature) Specifies the names of the spaces to be backed up. All spaces will be backed up if not specified. Multiple spaces can be specified, and format is `--spaces nba_01 --spaces nba_02`. |
| `--storage` | string | Yes | None | The target storage URL of BR backup data. The format is: \<Schema\>://\<PATH\>. <br>Schema: Optional values are `local` and `s3`. <br>When selecting s3, you need to fill in `s3.access_key`, `s3.endpoint`, `s3.region`, and `s3.secret_key`.<br>PATH: The path of the storage location. |
| `--s3.access_key` | string | No | None | Sets AccessKey ID. |
| `--s3.endpoint` | string | No | None | Sets the S3 endpoint URL, please specify the HTTP or HTTPS scheme explicitly. |
| `--s3.region` | string | No | None | Sets the region or location to upload or download the backup. |
| `--s3.secret_key` | string | No | None | Sets SecretKey for AccessKey ID. |

## Next to do

After the backup files are generated, you can use the BR to restore them for NebulaGraph. For more information, see [Use BR to restore data](4.br-restore-data.md).

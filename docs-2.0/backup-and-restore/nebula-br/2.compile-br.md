# Compile BR

For now, the BR is not provided as a package. You need to compile the BR first.

## Prerequisites

To compile the BR, do a check of these:

- [Go](https://github.com/golang/go "Click to go to GitHub") 1.14.x or a later version is installed.
- make is installed.

## Procedures

To compile the BR, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `nebula-br` repository to your machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-br.git
    ```

2. Change to the `br` directory.

    ```bash
    cd nebula-br
    ```

3. Compile the BR.

    ```bash
    make
    ```

Users can enter `bin/br version` on the command line. If the following results are returned, the BR is compiled successfully.

```bash
[nebula-br]$ bin/br version
Nebula Backup And Restore Utility Tool,V-{{br.release}}
```

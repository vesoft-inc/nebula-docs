# Deploy Dashboard

The deployment of Dashboard involve five services. This topic will describe how to deploy Dashboard in detail.

## Nebula Graph releases

The correspondence between the Dashboard release and the Nebula Graph release is as follows.

|Dashboard|Nebula Graph|
|:---|:---|
|{{dashboard.release}}|2.5.0, 2.0.1|

## Port

The deployment of Dashboard occupies the following ports:

- 9200

- 9100

- 9090

- 8090

- 7003

## Download Dashboard

Download the configuration files for the deployment.

```bash
wget https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-graph-dashboard/{{dashboard.release}}.tar.gz
```

## Service

Run `tar -xvf {{dashboard.release}}.tar.gz` to decompress the installation package. There are 5 services in the `nebula-graph-dashboard`. The descriptions are as follows.

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|node-exporter | Collects the source information of machines in the cluster, including the CPU, memory, load, disk, and network. |
|nebula-stats-exporter | Collects the performance metrics in the cluster, including the IP addresses, versions, and monitoring metrics (such as the number of queries, the latency of queries, the latency of heartbeats, and so on). |
|prometheus | The time series database that stores monitoring data. |
|nebula-http-gateway | Provides HTTP ports for cluster services to execute nGQL statements to interact with the Nebula Graph database. |
|nebula-graph-dashboard| Provides the Dashboard service. Note that its name is the same as its superordinate. The following `nebula-graph-dashboard` refers to this service. |

The above five services should be deployed as follows.

## Procedure

### Deploy `node-exporter`

!!! note

    You need to deploy the `node-exporter` service on each machine in the cluster.

To start the service, run the following statement in `node-exporter`:

```bash
$ nohup ./node-exporter --web.listen-address=:9100 &
```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9100` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `nebula-stats-exporter`

!!! note

    You only need to deploy the `nebula-stats-exporter` service on the machine where the `nebula-graph-dashboard` service is installed.

1. Modify the `config.yaml` file in `nebula-stats-exporter` to deploy the HTTP ports of all the services. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
  version: v0.0.2
  nebulaItems:
      - instanceName: metad0
        endpointIP: 192.168.xx.1
        endpointPort: 19559
        componentType: metad
      - instanceName: metad1
        endpointIP: 192.168.xx.2
        endpointPort: 19559
        componentType: metad
      - instanceName: metad2
        endpointIP: 192.168.xx.3
        endpointPort: 19559
        componentType: metad
      - instanceName: graphd0
        endpointIP: 192.168.xx.4
        endpointPort: 19669
        componentType: graphd
      - instanceName: storaged0
        endpointIP: 192.168.xx.5
        endpointPort: 19779
        componentType: storaged
      - instanceName: storaged1
        endpointIP: 192.168.xx.6
        endpointPort: 19779
        componentType: storaged
      - instanceName: storaged2
        endpointIP: 192.168.xx.7
        endpointPort: 19779
  ```

2. Run the following statement to start the service:

  ```bash
  $ nohup ./nebula-stats-exporter --bare-metal --bare-metal-config=./config.yaml &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9200` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `prometheus`

!!! note

   You only need to deploy the `prometheus` service on the machine where the `nebula-graph-dashboard` service is installed.

1. Modify the `prometheus.yaml` file in `prometheus` to deploy the IP addresses and ports of the `node-exporter` service and the `nebula-stats-exporter`. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
  global:
    scrape_interval:     5s
    evaluation_interval: 5s
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'nebula-exporter'
      static_configs:
        - targets: [
            '192.168.xx.100:9200',  # The IP address and port of the nebula-stats-exporter service.
          ]
    - job_name: 'node-exporter'
      static_configs:
        - targets: [
            '192.168.xx.101:9100'  # The IP address and port of the node-exporter service.
          ]
  ```

  - scrape_interval: The interval for collecting the monitoring data, which is 1 minute by default.

  - evaluation_interval: The interval for running alarm rules, which is 1 minute by default.

2. Run the following statement to start the service.

  ```bash
  $ nohup ./prometheus --config.file=./prometheus.yaml &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9090` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `nebula-http-gateway`

!!! note

    You only need to deploy the `nebula-http-gateway` service on the machine where the `nebula-graph-dashboard` service is installed.

To start the service, run the following statement in `nebula-http-gateway`:

```bash
$ nohup ./nebula-httpd &
```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:8090` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### How to deploy the `nebula-graph-dashboard` service

1. Modify the `custom.json` file in `nebula-graph-dashboard/static/` to deploy the IP address and port of the Graph Service. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
  {
      "connection": {
          "ip": "192.168.xx.4",
          "port": 9669
      },
      "alias": {
          "ip:port": "instance1"
      },
      "chartBaseLine": {

      }
  }
  ...
  ```

2. To start the service, run the following statement in `nebula-graph-dashboard`:

  ```bash
  $ npm run start
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:7003` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

## Stop Dashboard

You can enter `kill <pid>` to stop Dashboard. The examples are as follows:

```bash
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :9100) # stop the node-exporter service
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :9200) # stop the nebula-stats-exporter service
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :9090) # stop the prometheus service
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :8090) # stop the nebula-http-gateway service
$ cd nebula-graph-dashboard
$ npm run stop # stop the nebula-graph-dashboard service
```

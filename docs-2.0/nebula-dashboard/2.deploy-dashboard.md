# Deploy Dashboard

The deployment of Dashboard involves five services. This topic will describe how to deploy Dashboard in detail. To download and compile the latest source code of Nebula Dashboard, follow the instructions on the [nebula dashboard GitHub page](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-dashboard).

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy Dashboard, you must confirm that:

- The Nebula Graph services are deployed and started. For more information, see [Nebula Graph Database Manual](../2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow.md).

- Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied.
  
  - 9200

  - 9100

  - 9090

  - 8090

  - 7003

- The Linux distribution is CentOS, installed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) of version above v10.12.0 and [Go](https://golang.org/) of version above 1.13.

## Download Dashboard

Download the tar package as needed, and it is recommended to select the latest version.

| Dashboard package | Nebula Graph version |
| :----- | :----- |
| [nebula-dashboard-{{ dashboard.release }}.x86_64.tar.gz](https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-graph-dashboard/{{ dashboard.release }}/nebula-dashboard-{{ dashboard.release }}.x86_64.tar.gz) | 2.5.1~3.0.1 |

## Service

Run `tar -xvf nebula-dashboard-{{ dashboard.release }}.x86_64.tar.gz` to decompress the installation package. There are four services in the `nebula-dashboard/vendors`. The descriptions are as follows.

|Name|Description||Port|
|:---|:---|:---|
|node-exporter | Collects the source information of machines in the cluster, including the CPU, memory, load, disk, and network. |9100|
|nebula-stats-exporter | Collects the performance metrics in the cluster, including the IP addresses, versions, and monitoring metrics (such as the number of queries, the latency of queries, the latency of heartbeats, and so on). |9200|
|prometheus | The time series database that stores monitoring data. |9090|
|nebula-http-gateway | Provides HTTP ports for cluster services to execute nGQL statements to interact with the Nebula Graph database. |8090|

The above four services should be deployed as follows.

## Procedure

### Deploy `node-exporter`

!!! note

    You need to deploy the `node-exporter` service on each machine in the cluster.

To start the service, run the following statement in `node-exporter`:

```bash
$ nohup ./node-exporter --web.listen-address=":9100" &
```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9100` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `nebula-stats-exporter`

!!! note

    You only need to deploy the `nebula-stats-exporter` service on the machine where the `nebula-dashboard` service is installed.

1. Modify the `config.yaml` file in `nebula-stats-exporter` to deploy the HTTP ports of all the services. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
  clusters:
    - name: nebula
      instances:
        - name: metad0
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
          endpointPort: 19559
          componentType: metad
        - name: metad1
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
          endpointPort: 19559
          componentType: metad
        - name: metad2
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
          endpointPort: 19559
          componentType: metad
        - name: graphd0
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
          endpointPort: 19669
          componentType: graphd
        - name: graphd1
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
          endpointPort: 19669
          componentType: graphd
        - name: graphd2
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
          endpointPort: 19669
          componentType: graphd
        - name: storaged0
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
          endpointPort: 19779
          componentType: storaged
        - name: storaged1
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
          endpointPort: 19779
          componentType: storaged
        - name: storaged2
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
          endpointPort: 19779
          componentType: storaged
  ```

2. Run the following statement to start the service:

  ```bash
  $ nohup  ./nebula-stats-exporter --listen-address=":9200" --bare-metal --bare-metal-config=./config.yaml &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9200` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `prometheus`

!!! note

    You only need to deploy the `prometheus` service on the machine where the `nebula-dashboard` service is installed.

1. Modify the `prometheus.yaml` file in `prometheus` to deploy the IP addresses and ports of the `node-exporter` service and the `nebula-stats-exporter`. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
  global:
    scrape_interval:     5s
    evaluation_interval: 5s
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'nebula-stats-exporter'
      static_configs:
        - targets: [
            '192.168.xx.100:9200',  # IP address and port of nebula-stats-exporter.
          ]
    - job_name: 'node-exporter'
      static_configs:
        - targets: [
            '192.168.xx.100:9100',  # IP address and port of node-exporter.
            '192.168.xx.101:9100'
          ]
  ```

  - scrape_interval: The interval for collecting the monitoring data, which is 1 minute by default.

  - evaluation_interval: The interval for running alert rules, which is 1 minute by default.

2. Run the following statement to start the service.

  ```bash
  $ nohup ./prometheus --config.file=./prometheus.yaml &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9090` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `nebula-http-gateway`

!!! note

    You only need to deploy the `nebula-http-gateway` service on the machine where the `nebula-dashboard` service is installed.

To start the service, run the following statement in `nebula-http-gateway`:

```bash
$ nohup ./nebula-httpd &
```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:8090` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### How to deploy the `nebula-dashboard` service

1. Modify the `config.json` file in `nebula-dashboard/` to deploy the IP address and port of the Graph Service and Proxy. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
    port: 7003
    proxy:
      gateway:
        target: "127.0.0.1:8090"  // The IP address and port of the gateway service.
      prometheus:
        target: "127.0.0.1:9090"  // The IP address and port of the prometheus service.
      nebulaServer:
        ip: "192.168.8.143"  // The IP of the machine where your Nebula Graph is deployed.
        port: 9669 // The port of the Nebula Graph.
    ...
  ```

2. To start the service, run the following statement in `nebula-dashboard`:

  ```bash
  $ nohup ./dashboard &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:7003` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

## Stop Dashboard

You can enter `kill <pid>` to stop Dashboard. The examples are as follows:

```bash
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :9100) # stop the node-exporter service
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :9200) # stop the nebula-stats-exporter service
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :9090) # stop the prometheus service
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :8090) # stop the nebula-http-gateway service
$ kill $(lsof -t -i :7003) # stop dashboard service
```

# Deploy Dashboard

The deployment of Dashboard involves five services. This topic will describe how to deploy Dashboard in detail. To download and compile the latest source code of Nebula Dashboard, follow the instructions on the [nebula dashboard GitHub page](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-dashboard).

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy Dashboard, you must confirm that:

- The Nebula Graph services are deployed and started. For more information, see [Nebula Graph Database Manual](../2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow.md).

- Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied.
  
  - 9200

  - 9100

  - 9090

  - 8090

  - 7003

- The Linux distribution is CentOS, installed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) of version above v10.12.0 and [Go](https://golang.org/) of version above 1.13.

## Download Dashboard

Download the tar package as needed, and it is recommended to select the latest version.

| Dashboard package | Nebula Graph version |
| :----- | :----- |
| [nebula-dashboard-{{ dashboard.release }}.x86_64.tar.gz](https://oss-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-graph-dashboard/{{ dashboard.release }}/nebula-dashboard-{{ dashboard.release }}.x86_64.tar.gz) | 2.5.x~3.1.0 |

## Services

Run `tar -xvf nebula-dashboard-{{ dashboard.release }}.x86_64.tar.gz` to decompress the installation package. There are four services in the `nebula-dashboard/vendors`. The descriptions are as follows.

|Name|Description|Port|
|:---|:---|:---|
|node-exporter | Collects the source information of nodes in the cluster, including the CPU, memory, load, disk, and network. |9100|
|nebula-stats-exporter | Collects the performance metrics in the cluster, including the IP addresses, versions, and monitoring metrics (such as the number of queries, the latency of queries, the latency of heartbeats, and so on). |9200|
|prometheus | The time series database that stores monitoring data. |9090|
|nebula-http-gateway | Provides HTTP ports for cluster services to execute nGQL statements to interact with the Nebula Graph database. |8090|

## Method One - Deploy Dashboard services one by one

### Deploy `node-exporter`

!!! Caution

    You need to deploy the `node-exporter` service on each node in the cluster.

To start the service, run the following statement in `node-exporter`:

```bash
$ nohup ./node-exporter --web.listen-address=":9100" &
```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9100` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `nebula-stats-exporter`

!!! Caution

    You only need to deploy the `nebula-stats-exporter` service on the node where the `nebula-dashboard` service is installed.

1. Modify the `config.yaml` file in `nebula-stats-exporter` to deploy the HTTP ports of all the services. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
  clusters:
    - name: nebula
      instances:
        - name: metad0
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
          endpointPort: 19559
          componentType: metad
        - name: metad1
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
          endpointPort: 19559
          componentType: metad
        - name: metad2
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
          endpointPort: 19559
          componentType: metad
        - name: graphd0
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
          endpointPort: 19669
          componentType: graphd
        - name: graphd1
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
          endpointPort: 19669
          componentType: graphd
        - name: graphd2
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
          endpointPort: 19669
          componentType: graphd
        - name: storaged0
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
          endpointPort: 19779
          componentType: storaged
        - name: storaged1
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
          endpointPort: 19779
          componentType: storaged
        - name: storaged2
          endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
          endpointPort: 19779
          componentType: storaged
  ```

2. Run the following statement to start the service:

  ```bash
  $ nohup  ./nebula-stats-exporter --listen-address=":9200" --bare-metal --bare-metal-config=./config.yaml &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9200` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `prometheus`

!!! Caution

    You only need to deploy the `prometheus` service on the node where the `nebula-dashboard` service is installed.

1. Modify the `prometheus.yaml` file in `prometheus` to deploy the IP addresses and ports of the `node-exporter` service and the `nebula-stats-exporter`. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
  global:
    scrape_interval:     5s
    evaluation_interval: 5s
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'nebula-stats-exporter'
      static_configs:
        - targets: [
            '192.168.xx.100:9200',  # IP address and port of nebula-stats-exporter.
          ]
    - job_name: 'node-exporter'
      static_configs:
        - targets: [
            '192.168.xx.100:9100',  # IP address and port of node-exporter.
            '192.168.xx.101:9100'
          ]
  ```

  - scrape_interval: The interval for collecting the monitoring data, which is 1 minute by default.

  - evaluation_interval: The interval for running alert rules, which is 1 minute by default.

2. Run the following statement to start the service.

  ```bash
  $ nohup ./prometheus --config.file=./prometheus.yaml &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:9090` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `nebula-http-gateway`

!!! Caution

    You only need to deploy the `nebula-http-gateway` service on the node where the `nebula-dashboard` service is installed.

To start the service, run the following statement in `nebula-http-gateway`:

```bash
$ nohup ./nebula-httpd &
```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:8090` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

### Deploy `nebula-dashboard`

1. Modify the `config.json` file in `nebula-dashboard/` to deploy the IP address and port of the Graph Service and Proxy. The example is as follows:

  ```bash
    port: 7003
    proxy:
      gateway:
        target: "127.0.0.1:8090"  // The IP address and port of the gateway service.
      prometheus:
        target: "127.0.0.1:9090"  // The IP address and port of the prometheus service.
      nebulaServer:
        ip: "192.168.8.143"  // The IP of the node where your Nebula Graph is deployed.
        port: 9669 // The port of the Nebula Graph.
    ...
  ```

2. To start the service, run the following statement in `nebula-dashboard`:

  ```bash
  $ nohup ./dashboard &
  ```

After the service is started, you can enter `<IP>:7003` in the browser to check whether the service is started normally.

## Method Two - Deploy Dashboard with Docker Compose

You can follow the below steps to deploy Dashboard with Docker Compose.

### Prerequisite

You've installed Docker on the node where Dashboard is deployed. 

### Steps

1. In the `nebula-dashboard` directory on each node of your Nebula Graph cluster, go to `vendors/node-exporter` and run the following command to start `node-exporter` respectively.
   
    ```bash
    nohup ./node-exporter --web.listen-address=":9100" &
    ```

    !!! note

        You can decide whether to start the `node-exporter` service on each node in the cluster as needed.


2. In the `nebula-dashboard` directory on the node where Dashboard to be installed, deploy Dashboard services.
   
  1. Modify the `config.yaml` file in the `vendors/nebula-stats-exporter` directory to deploy the ports and IP addresses of all the Nebula Graph services. The example is as follows:
   
    ```yaml
    clusters:
      - name: nebula
        instances:
          - name: metad0
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
            endpointPort: 19559
            componentType: metad
          - name: metad1
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
            endpointPort: 19559
            componentType: metad
          - name: metad2
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
            endpointPort: 19559
            componentType: metad
          - name: graphd0
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
            endpointPort: 19669
            componentType: graphd
          - name: graphd1
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
            endpointPort: 19669
            componentType: graphd
          - name: graphd2
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
            endpointPort: 19669
            componentType: graphd
          - name: storaged0
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.157
            endpointPort: 19779
            componentType: storaged
          - name: storaged1
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.155
            endpointPort: 19779
            componentType: storaged
          - name: storaged2
            endpointIP: 192.168.8.154
            endpointPort: 19779
            componentType: storaged
    ```    

  2. Modify the `prometheus.yaml` file in the `vendors/prometheus` directory to deploy the port and IP address of the `node-exporter` service, and the port and hostname of the `nebula-stats-exporter` service. The example is as follows:
   
    ```bash
    global:
      scrape_interval:     5s  # The interval for collecting the monitoring data, which is 1 minute by default.
      evaluation_interval: 5s  # The interval for running alert rules, which is 1 minute by default.
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'node-exporter'
        static_configs:
          - targets: [
              '192.168.8.154:9100',
              '192.168.8.155:9100',
              '192.168.8.157:9100'  # The IP address of the node where the node-exporter service is deployed and the port of the node-exporter service.
            ]
      - job_name: 'nebula-stats-exporter'
        static_configs:
          - targets: [
            'nebula-stats-exporter:9200',  # The hostname of the nebula-stats-exporter container and the port of the nebula-stats-exporter service.
            ]
    ```

  3. Modify the `config.json` file in the `nebula-dashboard` directory to configure the proxy information.

    ```json
    {
      "port": 7003,
      "proxy":{
        "gateway":{
          "target": "nebula-http-gateway:8090"  # The hostname of the nebula-http-gateway container and the port of the nebula-http-gateway service. 
        },
        "prometheus":{
          "target": "prometheus:9090"    # The hostname of the prometheus container and the port of the prometheus service. 
        }
      },
      "nebulaServer": {                  # The access information of any Graph service.
        "ip": "192.168.8.131",           # The IP address of the node where the Graph service is deployed.
        "port": 9669                     # The port of the Graph service. 
      }
    }
    ```
        
3. Run the following command in any directory to create a network for all the Dashboard service containers communicating with each other. 
   
  ```bash
  docker network create nebula-net
  ```

4. In `nebula-dashboard`, run the following command to start all the Dashboard services.
   
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
  ```
  
  For details about the parameter descriptions in `docker-compose.yaml`, see [Service configuration reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#service-configuration-reference).

   
5. Run `docker ps` to view the status of all the services, and then conduct the following performance to check if the services are all started. 
   
  - Enter `<IP>:9200` to check the status of the `nebula-stats-exporter` service.
  - Enter `<IP>:9100` to check the status of the `node-exporter` service.
  - Enter `<IP>:9090` to check the status of the `prometheus` service.
  - Enter `<IP>:8090` to check the status of the `nebula-http-gateway` service.
  - Enter `<IP>:7003` to check the status of the `dashboard` service.

## Stop Dashboard

- If your Dashboard is started by deploying services one bye one, run `kill <pid>` to stop Dashboard. The examples are as follows:

  ```bash
  $ kill $(lsof -t -i :9100) # stop the node-exporter service
  $ kill $(lsof -t -i :9200) # stop the nebula-stats-exporter service
  $ kill $(lsof -t -i :9090) # stop the prometheus service
  $ kill $(lsof -t -i :8090) # stop the nebula-http-gateway service
  $ kill $(lsof -t -i :7003) # stop dashboard service
  ```

- If your Dashboard is started with Docker Compose, run `docker-compose stop`.

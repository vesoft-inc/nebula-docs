# Metrics

This topic will describe the monitoring metrics in Nebula Dashboard.

## Machine

!!! note

    - All the machine metrics listed below are for the Linux operating system.
    - The default unit in **Disk** and **Network** is byte. The unit will change with the data magnitude as the page displays. For example, when the flow is less than 1 KB/s, the unit will be Bytes/s.
    - For versions of Dashboard Community Edition greater than v1.0.2, the memory occupied by Buff and Cache will not be counted in the memory usage.

# Metrics

This topic will describe the monitoring metrics in NebulaGraph Dashboard.

## Machine

!!! note

    - All the machine metrics listed below are for the Linux operating system.
    - The default unit in **Disk** and **Network** is byte. The unit will change with the data magnitude as the page displays. For example, when the flow is less than 1 KB/s, the unit will be Bytes/s.
    - For versions of Dashboard Community Edition greater than v1.0.2, the memory occupied by Buff and Cache will not be counted in the memory usage.

### CPU

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`cpu_utilization`| The percentage of used CPU. |
|`cpu_idle`| The percentage of idled CPU. |
|`cpu_wait`| The percentage of CPU waiting for IO operations. |
|`cpu_user`| The percentage of CPU used by users. |
|`cpu_system`| The percentage of CPU used by the system. |

### Memory

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`memory_utilization`| The percentage of used memory. |
|`memory_used`| The memory space used (not including caches). |
|`memory_free`| The memory space available. |

### Load

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`load_1m`| The average load of the system in the last 1 minute. |
|`load_5m`| The average load of the system in the last 5 minutes. |
|`load_15m`| The average load of the system in the last 15 minutes. |

### Disk

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`disk_used_percentage`| The disk utilization percentage.|
|`disk_used`| The disk space used. |
|`disk_free`| The disk space available. |
|`disk_readbytes`| The number of bytes that the system reads in the disk per second. |
|`disk_writebytes`| The number of bytes that the system writes in the disk per second. |
|`disk_readiops`| The number of read queries that the disk receives per second. |
|`disk_writeiops`| The number of write queries that the disk receives per second. |
|`inode_utilization`| The percentage of used inode. |

### Network

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`network_in_rate`| The number of bytes that the network card receives per second. |
|`network_out_rate`| The number of bytes that the network card sends out per second. |
|`network_in_errs`| The number of wrong bytes that the network card receives per second. |
|`network_out_errs`| The number of wrong bytes that the network card sends out per second. |
|`network_in_packets`| The number of data packages that the network card receives per second. |
|`network_out_packets`| The number of data packages that the network card sends out per second. |

## Service

### Period

The period is the time range of counting metrics. It currently supports 5 seconds, 60 seconds, 600 seconds, and 3600 seconds, which respectively represent the last 5 seconds, the last 1 minute, the last 10 minutes, and the last 1 hour.

### Metric methods

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`rate`| The average rate of operations per second in a period. |
|`sum`| The sum of operations in the period. |
|`avg`| The average latency in the cycle. |
|`P75`| The 75th percentile latency. |
|`P95`| The 95th percentile latency. |
|`P99`| The 99th percentile latency. |
|`P999`| The 99.9th percentile latency. |


!!! note

    Dashboard collects the following metrics from the NebulaGraph core, but only shows the metrics that are important to it.

# Connect Dashboard

After Dashboard is deployed, you can log in and use Dashboard on the browser.

## Prerequisites

- The Dashboard services are started. For more information, see [Deploy Dashboard](2.deploy-dashboard.md).

- We recommend you to use the Chrome browser of the version above 58. Otherwise, there may be compatibility issues.

## Procedures

1. Confirm the IP address of the machine where the `nebula-dashboard` service is installed. Enter `<IP>:7003` in the browser to open the login page.

2. Enter the username and the passwords of the Nebula Graph database.

  !!! note

        Ensure that you have configured the IP of the machines where your Nebula Graph is deployed in the `config.json` file. For more information, see [Deploy Dashboard](2.deploy-dashboard.md).

  - If authentication is enabled, you can log in with the created accounts.

  - If authentication is not enabled, you can only log in using `root` as the username and random characters as the password.

  To enable authentication, see [Authentication](../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md).

3. Select the Nebula Graph version to be used.

  !!! note

        Make sure the version selected is the same with the version configured in the `config.json` file. Otherwise, you may encounter compatibility problems. For more information, see [Deploy Dashboard](2.deploy-dashboard.md).

2. In the **Workflows** tab, users can view all saved workflows. The list displays `Workflow name`, `Created time`, `Update time`, and `Algorithm`.

  - At the top of the list page, click **Comparison** and select two workflows or different historical versions of the same workflow for code comparison.

  - At the top of the list page, users can search workflow by keywords in the search box.

  - In the **Operation** column of the list page, users an perform the following operations:

    - **Run**: Instantiate the workflow directly as a job and execute the job.
    - **Open**: Open the workflow to view and modify the workflow. After modifying the workflow, click ![save](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/workflow-save-220623.png) to save the modification or click ![save](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/workflow-saveAs-220623.png) to save the workflow as a new workflow.
    - **View jobs**: Jump to the job list to view all the jobs instantiated by this workflow.
    - ![save](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/workflow-more-220623.png): Users can view the workflow code, rename the workflow, clone the workflow, and delete the workflow.

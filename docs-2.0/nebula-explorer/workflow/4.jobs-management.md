# Job management

This topic describes how to view the lists, progresses, results, logs of the jobs and rerun jobs.

## Steps

1. At the top of the Explorer page, click **Workflow**.

2. In the **Jobs** tab, users can view all the jobs. The page displays `Job ID`, `Job name`, `Status`, `CREATE time`, `End time` and `Workflow version`.

  - At the top of the list page, click **Comparison** and select two workflows or different jobs of the same workflow for code comparison.

  - At the top of the list page, users can filter the workflow and version in the filter box.

  - At the top of the list page, users can search the job by keywords in the search box.

  - In the **Operation** column of the list page, users an perform the following operations:

    - **View in Explorer**: For successfully executed jobs, users can select the graph space and the component to view the output of the component. Users can export the results to a CSV file.

    - **Rerun**: For failed executed jobs, users can rerun the job.

    - **Open**: Users can rerun the job and view the results and logs of the job. Users can also jump to the corresponding workflow for editing (the workflow is the latest version).

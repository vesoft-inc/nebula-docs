# Prepare resources

You must prepare your environment for running a workflow, including NebulaGraph configurations, HDFS configurations, and NebulaGraph Analytics configurations.

## Prerequisites

- NebulaGraph Analytics {{plato.release}} or later have been deployed. For details, see [NebulaGraph Analytics](../..//graph-computing/nebula-analytics.md).

- Dag Controller have been deployed and started. For details, see [Deploy Explorer](../deploy-connect/ex-ug-deploy.md).

## Steps

1. At the top of the Explorer page, click **Workflow**.

2. In the **Workflows** tab, click **Configuration**.

3. Configure the following resources:

  |Type|Description|
  |:--|:--|
  |NebulaGraph Configuration| The access address of the graph service that executes a graph query or to which the graph computing result is written. The default address is the address that you use to log into Explorer and can not be changed. You can set timeout periods for three services.|
  |HDFS Configuration| The HDFS address that stores the result of the graph query or graph computing. Click **Add** to add a new address, you can set the HDFS name, HDFS path, and HDFS username (optional).

# Explorer console

Explorer console allows you to enter nGQL statements and visualize the query results.

At the upper right corner of the page, click ![console](figs/nav-console.png) to enter the console page.

The Explorer's console feature is the same as Studio's. For more information, see [Console](../nebula-studio/quick-start/st-ug-console.md).

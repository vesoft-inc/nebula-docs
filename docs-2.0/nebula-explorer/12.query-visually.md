# Visual Query

The Visual Query feature uses a visual representation to express related requests. It allows you to create query scenarios to look up the desired data and view the corresponding statements. You can construct visual query statements by simply dragging and dropping, and then the system displays the query results on the query panel.

!!! compatibility

    The Visual Query feature is not compatible with NebulaGraph versions below 3.0.0. 


!!! note

    Currently, the Visual Query feature is still in beta.

## Prerequisite

- You have choosen a graph space. For details, see [Choose graph spaces](graph-explorer/13.choose-graphspace.md).
- You have created indexes for particular queries. For details, see [MATCH precautions](../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/2.match.md) and [CREATE INDEX](../3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/1.create-native-index.md).

## Page elements

![visual_overview](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-query-20220718-en.png)

At the top of the Explorer page, click **Visual Query** to enter the visual query page. On the left side of the **Visual Query** page, all the Tag(s) corresponding to the graph space (e.g.player and team) and the Tag named **Any Tag** are displayed. You can query vertices without tags by the Tag named **Any Tag**.

!!! note

    **Any Tag** can also be used to query the vertex without tags.

On the page, the descriptions of other icons are as follows.

## Steps

1. Drag several target tags from the left side of the **Visual Query** page to the canvas to create the corresponding vertices.

2. Click a vertex, hold down the left mouse button on the anchor point at the edge of the vertex, and drag it to another vertex to create the corresponding edge.

3. Set a vertex by clicking it. The descriptions of configuration options are as follows.

  ![vertex_confi](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/vertex-config_en.png)

  - **Tag Name**: Set zero, one, or multiple tags.

  !!! note

        One vertex can have zero or multiple tags:

      - When 0 tag is set, query the vertex without tags.
      - When 1 tag is set, query the vertex with that tag.
      - When multiple tags are set, query the vertex that has all the tags you set. 

  - **Filter**: Add one or more sets of filter conditions, including vertex properties, operators, and property values. 

  !!! note

        When setting multiple tags in the **Tag Name** dialog box, it is not supported to set **filter conditions** to query data.

4.  Set an edge by clicking. The descriptions configuration options are as follows.

  ![vertex_confi](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/edge-config_en.png)

  - **Edge Type**: Set one or multiple edge types.

  !!! note

        One edge have one and only one edge type:

      - When one edge type is set, query the edge with that edge type.

      - When multiple edge types are set, query the edge that has any of the edge types you set.

  - **Direction**: Set the edge direction between two vertices, including Outgoing, Incoming, and Bidirect.

  - **Single**: Set a fixed-length path.

  - **Range**: Set a variable-length.

  - **Filter**: Add one or more sets of filter conditions, including edge properties, operators, and property values.

  !!! note

        When setting multiple edge types in the **Edge Type** dialog box, it is not supported to set **filter conditions** to query data.

5. After the query scenarios (pattern) is created, click ![Output](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-nav-output.png) and select the result you want to return.

6. Click **Run Query** on the upper right corner of the **Visual Query** page to display the query results on the canvas.

## Examples

### Example 1 

Find out players who follow each other with Yao Ming and older than 35, and which teams these players are loyal to, and limit the number of the query patterns of the players and teams to 6.

![query_visually_example_1](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/query_visaully_example_1_en.gif)

1. Create a query pattern by dragging and dropping Tags to the panel (2 players and 1 team). 

2. Configure filter conditions.

   1. Set the filter condition for the first player to `player.name == Yao Ming`.
   2. Set the edge type of the edge between the first and second vertices of the tag player to `follow`, set the direction to `Bidirect`, and the steps to `1`.
   3. Set the filter condition for the second player to `player.age > 35`.
   4. Set the edge type of the edge between the second player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   5. Click ![Output](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-nav-output.png) to select the second player, the team, and the serve edge between them.
   6. Click the **Query Pattern** frame, and set the **Limit Number** to `6`.

3. Click **Run Query**, and the system displays 6 query patterns on the canvas.


### Example 2

Find out what teams two mutually-following players are loyal to and query for all players on that team who are older than 30.

![query_visually_example_2](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/query_visaully_example_2_en.gif)

1. Create a query pattern by dragging and dropping Tags to the panel (3 players and 1 team).
2. Configure filter conditions.

   1. Set the edge type of the edge between the first and second players to `follow`, set the direction to `Bidirect`, and the steps to `1`.
   2. Set the edge type of the edge between the first player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   3. Set the edge type of the edge between the second player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   4. Set the filter conditions for the third player to `player.age > 30`.
   5. Set the edge type of the edge between the third player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   6. Click ![Output](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-nav-output.png) to select the third player, the team, and the serve edge between them.

3. Click **Run Query**.

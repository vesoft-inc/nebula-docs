# Visual Query

The Visual Query feature uses a visual representation to express related requests. It allows you to create query scenarios to look up the desired data and view the corresponding statements. You can construct visual query statements by simply dragging and dropping, and then the system displays the query results on the query panel.

## Prerequisite

- You have choosen a graph space. For details, see [Choose graph spaces](13.choose-graphspace.md).
- You have created indexes for particular queries. For details, see [Note](../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/2.match.md) and [CREATE INDEX](../3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/1.create-native-index.md).

!!! compatibility

    The Visual Query feature is not compatible with Nebula Graph versions below 3.0.0. 

## Steps

At the top of the Explorer page, click **Visual Query** to enter the visual query page.

## Page elements

![visual_overview](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-overview_en.png)

On the left side of the **Visual Query** page, all the Tag(s) corresponding to the graph space (e.g.player and team) and the Tag named **Any Tag** are displayed. You can query vertices without tags by the Tag named **Any Tag**.

On the page, the descriptions of other icons are as follows.

| Icon/Element                                                    | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Output](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-nav-output.png) | The selected vertices and edges are the results to be queried. Double-click on the query pattern frame to limit the number of queries (with a priority higher than the value of the maximum number of returns in the global settings). Only querying edges is not supported.  |

## Examples

### Example 1 

Find out players who follow each other with Yao Ming and older than 35, and which teams these players are loyal to, and limit the number of the query patterns of the players and teams to 6.

![query_visually_example_1](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/query_visaully_example_1_en.gif)

1. Create a query pattern by dragging and dropping Tags to the panel (2 players and 1 team). 

2. Configure filter conditions.

   1. Set the filter condition for the first player to `player.name == Yao Ming`.
   2. Set the edge type of the edge between the first and second players to `follow`, set the direction to `Bidirect`, and the steps to `1`.
   3. Set the filter condition for the second player to `player.age > 35`.
   4. Set the edge type of the edge between the second player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   5. Click ![Output](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-nav-output.png) to select the second player, the team, and the serve edge between them.
   6. Click the **Query Pattern** frame, and set the **Limit Number** to `6`.

3. Click **Run Query**, and the system displays 6 query patterns on the canvas.


### Example 2

Find out what teams two mutually-following players are loyal to and query for all players on that team who are older than 30.

![query_visually_example_2](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/query_visaully_example_2_en.gif)

1. Create a query pattern by dragging and dropping Tags to the panel (3 players and 1 team).
2. Configure filter conditions.

   1. Set the edge type of the edge between the first and second players to `follow`, set the direction to `Bidirect`, and the steps to `1`.
   2. Set the edge type of the edge between the first player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   3. Set the edge type of the edge between the second player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   4. Set the filter conditions for the third player to `player.age > 30`.
   5. Set the edge type of the edge between the third player and the team to `serve`, the direction to `Outgoing`, and the steps to `1`.
   6. Click ![Output](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/visual-nav-output.png) to select the third player, the team, and the serve edge between them.

3. Click **Run Query**.

# Create a schema

Before using Nebula Graph to query data, you must have a schema. Explorer allows you to create a schema both using GUI and using commands. 

At the upper right corner of the page, click ![schema](figs/studio-nav-schema.png) to enter the schema creation page.

The Explorer's schema feature is the same as Studio's. For more information, see [Create a schema](../nebula-studio/quick-start/st-ug-create-schema.md).

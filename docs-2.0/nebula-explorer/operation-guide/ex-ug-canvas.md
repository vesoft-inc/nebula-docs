## Quick operation

You can select one or more vertexes and edges, and right-click in the blank area to expand the vertexes, search the path between two vertexes, and show or hide their property on the canvas. The number of vertexes and edges you choose will affect the operations that can be performed. For more information, see [Graph Exploration Expansion](../operation-guide/ex-ug-graph-exploration.md).

## RPM-based Explorer

### Prerequisites

Before you deploy Explorer, you must do a check of these:

- The Nebula Graph services are deployed and started. For more information, see [Nebula Graph Database Manual](../../2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow.md).

- Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied.

   | Port | Description |
   | ---- | ---- |
   | 7002 | Web service provided by Explorer |

- The Linux distribution is CentOS.
- GO of version above 1.13 is installed.
- The license is ready.

2. Use `sudo rpm -i <rpm>` to install RPM package.

   For example, use the following command to install Explorer. The default installation path is `/usr/local/nebula-explorer`.

   ```bash
   $ sudo rpm -i nebula-explorer-<version>.x86_64.rpm
   ```

   You can also install it to the specified path using the following command:
   ```bash
   $ sudo rpm -i nebula-explorer-xxx.rpm --prefix=<path> 
   ```

3. Copy the license to the installation path.

   ```bash
   $ cp -r <license> <explorer_path>
   ```

   For example:
   ```bash
   $ cp -r nebula.license /usr/local/nebula-explorer
   ```

4. After adding the license, you need to stop and restart the service using the following command.

   ```bash
   $ systemctl stop nebula-explorer #Stop the service
   $ systemctl start nebula-explorer #Start the service
   ```

### Start and stop

   ```

You can also start or stop the service manually using the following command in the installation directory.

   ```bash
   $ cd ./scripts/rpm
   $ bash ./start.sh #Start the service
   $ bash ./stop.sh #Stop the service
   ```

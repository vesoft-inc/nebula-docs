# Connect to Nebula Graph

After successfully launching Explorer, you need to configure to connect to Nebula Graph. This topic describes how Explorer connects to the Nebula Graph database.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting to the Nebula Graph database, you need to confirm the following information:

- The Nebula Graph services and Explorer are started. For more information, see [Deploy Explorer](../deploy-connect/ex-ug-connect.md).

- You have the local IP address and the port used by the Graph service of Nebula Graph. The default port is `9669`.

- You have a Nebula Graph account and its password.

  !!! note
        
        If authentication is enabled in Nebula Graph and different role-based accounts are created, you must use the assigned account to connect to Nebula Graph. If authentication is disabled, you can use the `root` and any password to connect to Nebula Graph. For more information, see [Nebula Graph Database Manual](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/).

## Procedure

To connect Explorer to Nebula Graph, follow these steps:

1. On the **Config Server** page of Explorer, configure these fields:

   - **Host**: Enter the IP address and the port of the Graph service of Nebula Graph. The valid format is `IP:port`. The default port is `9669`.  

    !!! note

        When Nebula Graph and Explorer are deployed on the same machine, you must enter the IP address of the machine, but not `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, in the **Host** field.

  - **Username** and **Password**: Fill in the log in account according to the authentication settings of Nebula Graph.

    - If authentication is not enabled, you can use `root` and any password as the username and its password.

    - If authentication is enabled and no account information has been created, you can only log in as GOD role and use `root` and `nebula` as the username and its password.

    - If authentication is enabled and different users are created and assigned roles, users in different roles log in with their accounts and passwords.

2. After the configuration, click the **Login** button.

  !!! note

        One session continues for up to 30 minutes. If you do not operate Explorer within 30 minutes, the active session will time out and you must connect to Nebula Graph again.

## Clear connection

When Explorer is still connected to a Nebula Graph database, on the upper right corner of the page, select ![icon](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/nav-setup.png) > **Clear Connect**.

After that, if the **configuration database** page is displayed on the browser, it means that Explorer has successfully disconnected from the Nebula Graph.

When Explorer is still connected to a Nebula Graph database, in the toolbar, select Settings ![icon](../figs/nav-setup.png) > clear connect, as shown in the below:

![clean](../figs/ex-ug-004.png)

After that, if the **configuration database** page is displayed on the browser, it means that Explorer has successfully disconnected from the Nebula Graph.

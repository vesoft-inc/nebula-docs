# Database user management

NebulaGraph Explorer supports managing the users in the NebulaGraph database, including creating users, deleting users, changing passwords, etc.

## Prerequisites

The user who logs in to Explorer must have permissions for related operations. For example, users with `God` permission can perform all operations, and users with `Admin` permission can authorize the permission of a graph space within their permission to other users. For details about role privileges, see [Roles and privileges](../..//7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

# Deployment Architecture

Creating a NebulaGraph service cluster in Azure Marketplace allows you to customize cluster components as needed. This topic describes the recommended deployment architecture for a production environment.

A typical cluster architecture in a production environment is shown in the following figure.

The preceding architecture sets up the following:

- An Azure resource group where the Azure resources for deploying the NebulaGraph service cluster are deployed and managed.
- A subnet in an Azure virtual network where the NebulaGraph service cluster is deployed.
- NebulaGraph Meta Service, Graph Service, and Storage Service respectively supported by the metad, graphd and storaged processes. Each process runs in a Google Cloud virtual machine instance.
- A NebulaGraph Explorer server for visualized exploration of NebulaGraph data.
- A NebulaGraph Dashboard server for monitoring and managing NebulaGraph hosts.

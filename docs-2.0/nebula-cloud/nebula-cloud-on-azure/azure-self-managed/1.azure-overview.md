# NebulaGraph on Azure overview

NebulaGraph offers a secure, reliable cloud service powered by Azure. You can use the Azure Marketplace to quickly deploy a NebulaGraph Enterprise service cluster, including the network, compute, storage, and visualization services.

## Costs

You are responsible for the Azure resources used to deploy and run the NebulaGraph service cluster.

When creating a NebulaGraph service cluster, some of the settings, such as the virtual machine type, storage media type, and disk space, affect the cost of deployment.

After you deploy the NebulaGraph service cluster, you can [analyze costs and create budgets with Microsoft Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/analyze-costs-create-budgets-azure-cost-management/) to understand how your costs accrue, and how to monitor and alert your costs.

In addition to Azure resources, you need valid licenses to keep the NebulaGraph services running. Applying for the licenses requires certain costs.

## Licenses

NebulaGraph on Azure applies the NebulaGraph Enterprise services with 3-day licenses by default. After the licenses expire, the services become unavailable but the data remains in the Azure resources.

For how to apply for and configure licenses, see [License](../../../4.deployment-and-installation/deploy-license.md).

## Core version

The supported NebulaGraph Enterprise core version is {{cloud.azureRelease}}.

# Create a subscription

Before using Nebula Graph Cloud, you need to create a subscription on Azure. This topic describes how to create a subscription on Azure Marketplace.

## Subscription workflow

1. Enter the [Azure Marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/?l=en.en-us#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryMenuBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home), and search for Nebula Graph Cloud in the search bar.

2. Click **Subscribe** on the Nebula Graph Cloud card, and select a plan according to your needs.

  Available plans are:

  | Plan | Description |
  | - | - |
  | 30-day free trial | A 30-day free trial. If you select this plan, you can only select the **Free** plan while [configuring Nebula Graph Solution](3.how-to-set-solution.md), but not the charged plans. |
  | Beta | Charged services. If you select this plan, you can only select the  **Enterprise** or **Developer** plan  while configuring Nebula Graph Solution later, but not the **Free** plan. |

  !!! caution

      - Each Azure account can only subscribe the **30-day Free trial** plan once and cannot subscribe this plan again after the expiration date.
      - You cannot switch the **30-day free trial** plan to other plans.

3. In the **Basics** tab on the **Subscribe To Nebula Graph Cloud** page, complete the following configuration.

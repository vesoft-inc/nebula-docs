# Deployment Architecture

Creating a NebulaGraph service cluster using the Deployment Manager templates allows you to customize cluster components as needed. This topic describes the recommended deployment architecture for a production environment.

A typical cluster architecture in a production environment is shown in the following figure.

The preceding architecture sets up the following:

- A virtual private cloud (VPC) where the NebulaGraph cluster in deployed.
- NebulaGraph Meta Service, Graph Service, and Storage Service respectively supported by metad, graphd and storaged processes. Each process runs in a Google Cloud virtual machine instance.
- A NebulaGraph Explorer server for visualized exploration of NebulaGraph data.
- A NebulaGraph Dashboard server for monitoring and managing NebulaGraph hosts.

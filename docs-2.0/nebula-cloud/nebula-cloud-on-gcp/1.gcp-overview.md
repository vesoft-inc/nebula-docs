# NebulaGraph on GCP overview

NebulaGraph offers a secure, reliable cloud service powered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can use the Google Cloud Deployment Manager templates to quickly deploy a NebulaGraph Enterprise service cluster, including the network, compute, storage, and visualization services.

## Costs

Google Cloud Deployment Manager does not charge for use, but any resources you deploy using Deployment Manager may incur charges. For example, Compute Engine charges for resources per the [Compute Engine price sheet](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing). For more information, see the price sheets for the respective products.

After you deploy the NebulaGraph service cluster, you can access the [Billing Reports](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/reports#overview) to monitor your costs and view the billing trends.

In addition, you need valid licenses to keep the NebulaGraph services running. Applying for the licenses requires certain costs.

## Licenses

NebulaGraph on GCP applies the NebulaGraph Enterprise services with 3-day licenses by default. After the licenses expire, the services become unavailable but the data remains in the GCP resources.

For how to apply for and configure licenses, see [License](../../4.deployment-and-installation/deploy-license.md).

## Core version

The Google Cloud Deployment Manager templates support NebulaGraph Enterprise core version {{cloud.gcpRelease}}.

# Create a service instance

To use NebulaGraph on Alibaba Cloud, you need to create a service instance on the Alibaba Cloud console.

## Account and permissions

- Prepare an [Alibaba Cloud account](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/basics-for-beginners/latest/overview "https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324606.html")ã€‚
- To create an instance using a RAM user, you need to grant the user the following permissions:

  - AliyunECSFullAccess
  - AliyunVPCFullAccess
  - AliyunROSFullAccess
  - AliyunCloudMonitorFullAccess
  - AliyunComputeNestUserFullAccess

## Resources and costs

NebulaGraph on Alibaba Cloud supports both free trial and paid usage, with the details shown in the following table.

| Item | Free Trial | Paid |
| - | - | - |
| Cloud resource ownership | Alibaba Cloud official account | User account |
| Cloud resource cost | **Alibaba Cloud covers** | User covers |
| Cloud resource usage duration | 30 days (non-renewable) | User chooses when creating an instance |
| NebulaGraph license cost | **Free during the trial period** | User covers |
| NebulaGraph license validity period | 30 days | User chooses when creating an instance |
| Whether data is retained after license expiration | No (as cloud resources will also expire) | Yes |
| Whether Data is retained after resource expiration | No | No |
| Data disk snapshot cost | **Alibaba Cloud covers** | User covers (can be disabled) |

## Data backup

When creating a service instance, the system will automatically enable the data disk snapshot feature to periodically back up NebulaGraph data.

Before creating a paid instance, you need to [enable snapshot](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service/latest/activate-ecs-snapshot). The free trial instance uses resources under the Alibaba Cloud official account and the snapshot service is already enabled, so you don't need to enable it manually.

The default snapshot backup policy is to create a snapshot at 00:00 every day.

For the costs of creating a snapshot, see [snapshot billing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service/latest/billing-items-snapshots).

To delete snapshots, modify or delete automatic snapshot policies. For more information, see [the snapshot documentation](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service/latest/elastic-compute-service-snapshots).

## Plan

NebulaGraph Cloud on Alibaba Cloud supports the following plans.

| Plan | Description |
| - | - |
| Basic | Deploys all NebulaGraph service nodes on 1 ECS server. |
| Standard | Deploys Graph service and Storage service on separate ECS servers, each service as a single node (1 ECS). Deploys Explorer and other ecosystem tools on 1 ECS server. |
| HA (High Availability) | Deploys Graph service and Storage service on separate ECS servers, each service includes 3 nodes (3 ECS). Deploys Explorer and other ecosystem tools on 1 ECS server. |

The plans supported by paid and free trial service instances differ. See the create instance page for details.

## Create a paid service instance

1. Log in to the [Alibaba Cloud console](https://home-intl.console.aliyun.com/).

2. Open the [NebulaGraph Enterprise](https://marketplace.alibabacloud.com/products/?category=57252001&code=sgcmgj00031218) page on the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace.

3. Select the **Version** and **Duration** (the license validity period of the NebulaGraph services), and then click **Buy Now**.

4. On the **Create Service Instance** page, keep the **Template Selection** section unchanged unless you want to switch the deployment architecture.

  !!! note

        Changing the template will change the previously selected plan, software fees (NebulaGraph license fees), and the resources required to create the service instance.

5. (Optional) Set the **Service Instance Name**. The default value is the service instance ID.

6. Select the **Region** where you want to create the service instance.

7. In the **Payment Method Settings** section, specify the payment method for the ECS server. The default is **Pay-As-You-Go**.

  - **Pay-As-You-Go**: Pay based on the billing cycle. A bill is generated for each settlement period, and the corresponding fees are deducted from your account. For more information, see [Pay-As-You-Go](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service/latest/billing-methods-pay-as-you-go).

  - **Subscription**: Pay before using. For more information, see [Subscription](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service/latest/billing-methods-subscription). If you choose the **Subscription** mode, you need to specify the **Billing Cycle** and the **Subscription Duration**. Currently, only **Month** is supported for the billing cycle, which means purchasing by month.

8. In the **NebulaGraph Configuration** section, complete the data disk and ECS server password settings.
  
9. In the **Infrastructure Configuration** section, complete the following settings.

<!-- ## FAQ

Q: What should I do if the status of my service instance is **Deployment Failed**?

1. If the instance was created using a RAM account, make sure that the account has been granted the permissions specified in the **Account and permissions** section of this topic.
2. If the permissions are correct, delete the failed instance and try to create a new one.
3. If you still encounter issues, contact support. -->

# Use service instances

Once the service instances are created, you can view their information and start using the NebulaGraph service.

## View service instances

You can view the detailed information of service instances in the Computing Nest console. For more information, see [View a service instance](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/computing-nest/latest/view-a-service-instance).

## View connection information

Before connecting to the service, you need to view the connection addresses for each service in the service instance details in the Alibaba Cloud Computing Nest. To view them, do the following:

1. Log on to the [Service Instances](https://computenest.console.aliyun.com/user/ap-southeast-1/serviceInstance/private "https://computenest.console.aliyun.com/user/ap-southeast-1/serviceInstance/private") page.

  !!! note

        If you are looking for a free trial service instance, you need to click the **Trial Service** tab on the **Service Instances** page.

2. In the instance list, click the **Service Instance ID** of the target instance, or **Details** in the **Actions** column to the right.

3. In the **Basic Information** area on the **Overview** tab, you can view the connection information for the Graph services, Storage services, as well as the ecosystem tools such as Explorer and Dashboard.

## Connect to NebulaGraph

NebulaGraph on Alibaba Cloud provides multiple ways of connection.

### Connect to NebulaGraph directly using clients

After obtaining the connection address, you can use various clients of NebulaGraph to connect to the service.

Connection method:

Connect to the private or public IP address of the Graph service directly. For detailed connection methods, see [Client Documentation](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/{{nebula.release}}/14.client/1.nebula-client/).

If you need to connect to the NebulaGraph database through the public network:

1. Find the public IP address of the ECS instance where the Graph service is deployed.

2. (This step is only required for the paid version) In the security group added to the NebulaGraph service instance, [add a security group rule](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service/latest/add-security-group-rules) to allow TCP port 9669 to be accessed from the specified public IP address.

  !!! note

        The free trial version allows Graph service's port 9669 to be accessed from the public network by default.

3. Access the NebulaGraph database using the public IP address of the Graph service and port 9669.

!!! caution

    It is recommended to connect only via a private IP address to enhance network and data security.

### Connect to NebulaGraph using Explorer

Using the graph exploration tool, you can quickly connect to NebulaGraph and interact with graph data visually.

Connection method:

1. Use the **Explorer service portal** to open Nebula Explorer in a browser.
2. Connect to NebulaGraph using Explorer. For more formation, see [Connect to the Database](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/{{nebula.release}}/nebula-explorer/deploy-connect/ex-ug-connect/).

## Monitor NebulaGraph

After deploying Dashboard in a NebulaGraph service instance, you can use Dashboard to monitor the status of NebulaGraph services in real time. For more formation, see [Dashboard Documentation](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/{{nebula.release}}/nebula-dashboard-ent/1.what-is-dashboard-ent/).

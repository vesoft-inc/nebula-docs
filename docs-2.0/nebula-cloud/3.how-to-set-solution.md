# Configure a Solution

Solution refers to the Nebula Graph database running on Nebula Graph Cloud. After subscribing Nebula Graph Cloud on Azure, you need to configure your Solutions on the Cloud platform to complete the purchase. This topic describes how to configure a Solution.

## Configuration workflow

1. After completing the [subscription creation](2.how-to-create-subsciption.md) and clicking **Configure account now** on the **Subscription progress** page, you are automatically logged in and redirected to the  **Choose Nebula Graph Cloud Plan** page.

  If it is the first time that this Azure account is used to create a solution, a **Permissions Requested** page pops out. Click **Accept** on this page.

2. On the **Choose Nebula Graph Cloud Plan** page, select a solution plan, and click the **Get Started Free** or **Create** button at the bottom of the selected plan card.

  Available plans are:

  All solution plans use the Nebula Graph Enterprise Edition core.

3. In the **Provider** area of the **Instance Settings** page, select a **Region** for creating the database.

  !!! caution

        To improve service performance, it is recommended to select an area that is the same as or closest to the service location.

4. In the **Instance** area, select the type and the number of the query engine, and the type, number, and disk size of the storage engine.

    !!! caution

        To ensure high availability, it is recommended to configure at least two query engines and three storage engines for the **Enterprise** plan.

5. In the **Nebula Graph** area, enter an email address of an Azure account as the **Root User**.

6. Confirm and check the **Service-Level Agreement**.

7. Click **Next** at the bottom right corner of the page.

8. On the confirmation page, confirm the service information. If the **Free** plan is selected, check **Nebula Graph Cloud will stop the solution after 24h of inactivity.** in the **Nebula Graph** area.

  !!! caution

        The free solution will be automatically stopped if the services has no activity for 24 hours.

9. Click **Create** at the bottom right corner of the page.

At this point, you have completed the configuration of the Solution. If the status of the Solution is **running** on the Cloud homepage, the Solution has been created successfully.

# What is NebulaGraph Cloud

NebulaGraph Cloud (Cloud for short) is a product that supports one-click deployment of NebulaGraph on the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) platform. You can create a graph database within minutes, and quickly expand computing and storage.

## Scenarios

You want to use Azure cloud resources to quickly subscribe to the NebulaGraph service and to deploy the NebulaGraph database to the cloud, supporting the use of visualized tools and functions of privilege management.

## Product features

- NebulaGraph Cloud provides pay-as-you-go and pay-on-demand subscription models. You can create or stop NebulaGraph instances at any time according to your own business needs, enjoying the full flexibility of the cloud.
- The cloud service also integrated our visualized database management tools such as [NebulaGraph Studio](https://nebula-graph.io/products/studio/), [Nebula Dashboard](https://nebula-graph.io/products/dashboard/), and [Nebula Explorer](https://nebula-graph.io/products/explorer/). You can use them to import graph datasets, execute nGQL statements, explore graph data, monitor data, etc. With those tools, you can quickly become a graph expert even without any experience in graph database operations. For details, see [Accessory applications](../nebula-cloud/5.solution/5.1.supporting-application.md).
- You can create private endpoints to connect to the cloud database using Nebula Console without having access to the cloud platform. For details, see [Private Link](../nebula-cloud/5.solution/5.2.connection-configuration-and-use.md).
- Fine-grained access control. You can add database users with different role privileges to the specified graph space to ensure your data security.
- Premium support. You can quickly create work orders for technical support, asking questions you have during your use.

## Product advantages

- Flexible and efficient: You can quickly build a NebulaGraph database without purchasing physical servers, storage devices, computing, or network components. It only takes 5-10 minutes to prepare a complete environment for use.
- High availability: NebulaGraph clusters use Raft to implement data redundancy backup with multi-data center deployment to ensure the integrity of data, and the high availability of the cloud computing infrastructure and cloud servers.
- Easy to use: Nebula Cloud offers a web-based management user interface of NebulaGraph clusters, as well as corresponding visualization tools for NebulaGraph to help users get started quickly.

# What is NebulaGraph Cloud

NebulaGraph Cloud (referred to as "Cloud") is a cloud-based service that integrates the NebulaGraph database and data services, and supports one-click deployment of NebulaGraph and related visualization products. Users can create a graph database in minutes and quickly scale computing and storage resources.

## Scenarios

You want to use Azure cloud resources to quickly subscribe to the NebulaGraph service and to deploy the NebulaGraph database to the cloud, supporting the use of visualized tools and functions of privilege management.

## Product features

- Instant availability: Users can create or stop NebulaGraph instances at any time based on their business needs, providing maximum flexibility.
- Integrated visualization tools: The NebulaGraph Dashboard and NebulaGraph Explorer visualization tools are integrated, allowing users to import graph datasets, execute nGQL queries, explore graph data, monitor data, and become graph experts even without graph database experience.
- Direct connection: Users can connect to cloud databases directly using client tools like NebulaGraph Console or from NebulaGraph Explorer without first accessing the cloud platform.
- Access control: Users can add database users with different role-based permissions to specified graph spaces, ensuring the security of data.
- Official support: Users can quickly create tickets to consult and resolve any issues encountered during usage.

## Product advantages

- Flexibility and scalability: Cloud's biggest advantage is its flexibility and scalability. Users can quickly (5-10 minutes) set up a NebulaGraph database without the need to purchase software or hardware.
- High availability: NebulaGraph clusters created on Cloud use the Raft protocol and, in conjunction with multiple data centers provided by cloud vendors, achieve data redundancy backup, ensuring the high availability of the cloud computing infrastructure and data reliability.
- User-friendly operation: Cloud provides a web page for online management of NebulaGraph clusters and supports visualization software, reducing user learning curves and enabling rapid use.

# Cloud Solution roles

After creating a Solution, you need to confirm the role privileges in the Cloud platform. This topic introduces the role privileges in the Cloud Solution.

## Built-in roles

NebulaGraph Cloud has multiple built-in roles:

- OWNER  
  - Correspond to the resource manager who can subscribe services and manage resource privileges.
  - Configure **Solution**, create and confirm services, and activate subscription.
  - Start and stop services of the **Solution**.
  - Authorizing the **ROOT** user in the database manually.
  - Access the database on the Cloud through a private endpoint.
  - View history logs.
  - Connect to Nebula Dashboard to monitor specified Solution nodes and services.

- ROOT
  - Correspond to the God of the NebulaGraph database, which is set by the OWNER. For privileges of the God role, see [Built-in role privileges](../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).
  - Manage users with the **USER** role in different spaces in the Cloud platform. When authorizing the **USER** role, you need to specify the role privileges of the NebulaGraph database, including **ADMIN**, **DBA**, **GUEST**, and **USER**. For details, see [Built-in role privileges](../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

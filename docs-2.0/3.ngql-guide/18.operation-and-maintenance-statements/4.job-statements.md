# Job manager and the JOB statements

The long-term tasks run by the Storage Service are called jobs, such as `COMPACT`, `FLUSH`, and `STATS`. These jobs can be time-consuming if the data amount in the graph space is large. The job manager helps you run, show, stop, and recover jobs.

!!! note

    All job management commands can be executed only after selecting a graph space.

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE IN ZONE

The `SUBMIT JOB BALANCE IN ZONE` statement starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in each zone in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. You can use the `REMOVE` option to specify the Storage services that you want to clear for easy maintenance.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE IN ZONE REMOVE 192.168.10.102:9779;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 26         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE ACROSS ZONE

The `SUBMIT JOB BALANCE ACROSS ZONE` statement starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions across all the zones in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. You can use the `REMOVE` option to specify the zones that you want to clear for easy maintenance.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE ACROSS ZONE REMOVE "zone1";
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 27         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB COMPACT

The `SUBMIT JOB COMPACT` statement triggers the long-term RocksDB `compact` operation in the current graph space.

For more information about `compact` configuration, see [Storage Service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md).

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB COMPACT;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 40         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB FLUSH

The `SUBMIT JOB FLUSH` statement writes the RocksDB memfile in the memory to the hard disk in the current graph space.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB FLUSH;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 96         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB STATS

The `SUBMIT JOB STATS` statement starts a job that makes the statistics of the current graph space. Once this job succeeds, you can use the `SHOW STATS` statement to list the statistics. For more information, see [SHOW STATS](../7.general-query-statements/6.show/14.show-stats.md).

!!! note

    If the data stored in the graph space changes, in order to get the latest statistics, you have to run `SUBMIT JOB STATS` again.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB STATS;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 34         |
+------------+
```

## SHOW JOB

The Meta Service parses a `SUBMIT JOB` request into multiple tasks and assigns them to the nebula-storaged processes. The `SHOW JOB <job_id>` statement shows the information about a specific job and all its tasks in the current graph space.

`job_id` is returned when you run the `SUBMIT JOB` statement.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW JOB 34;
+----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| Job Id(TaskId) | Command(Dest)   | Status     | Start Time                 | Stop Time                  |
+----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| 34             | "STATS"         | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:27.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:27.000000 |
| 0              | "192.168.8.111" | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:27.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:41.000000 |
+----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
```

The descriptions are as follows.

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                       |
|------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Job Id(TaskId)` | The first row shows the job ID and the other rows show the task IDs.                                              |
| `Command(Dest)`  | The first row shows the command executed and the other rows show on which storaged processes the task is running. |
| `Status`         | Shows the status of the job or task. For more information, see [Job status](#job_status).                         |
| `Start Time`     | Shows a timestamp indicating the time when the job or task enters the `RUNNING` phase.                            |
| `Stop Time`      | Shows a timestamp indicating the time when the job or task gets `FINISHED`, `FAILED`, or `STOPPED`.               |

### Job status

The descriptions are as follows.

| Status   | Description                                                                                                        |
|----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QUEUE    | The job or task is waiting in a queue. The `Start Time` is empty in this phase.                                    |
| RUNNING  | The job or task is running. The `Start Time` shows the beginning time of this phase.                               |
| FINISHED | The job or task is successfully finished. The `Stop Time` shows the time when the job or task enters this phase.   |
| FAILED   | The job or task has failed. The `Stop Time` shows the time when the job or task enters this phase.                 |
| STOPPED  | The job or task is stopped without running. The `Stop Time` shows the time when the job or task enters this phase. |
| REMOVED  | The job or task is removed.                                                                                        |

The description of switching the status is described as follows.

```ngql
Queue -- running -- finished -- removed
     \          \                /
      \          \ -- failed -- /
       \          \            /
        \ ---------- stopped -/
```

## SHOW JOBS

The `SHOW JOBS` statement lists all the unexpired jobs in the current graph space.

The default job expiration interval is one week. You can change it by modifying the `job_expired_secs` parameter of the Meta Service. For how to modify `job_expired_secs`, see [Meta Service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md).

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW JOBS;
+--------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| Job Id | Command             | Status     | Start Time                 | Stop Time                  |
+--------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| 34     | "STATS"             | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:27.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:27.000000 |
| 33     | "FLUSH"             | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:15.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:15.000000 |
| 32     | "COMPACT"           | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:06.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:06.000000 |
| 31     | "REBUILD_TAG_INDEX" | "FINISHED" | 2021-10-29T05:39:16.000000 | 2021-10-29T05:39:17.000000 |
| 10     | "COMPACT"           | "FINISHED" | 2021-10-26T02:27:05.000000 | 2021-10-26T02:27:05.000000 |
+--------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
```

## STOP JOB

The `STOP JOB <job_id>` statement stops jobs that are not finished in the current graph space.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> STOP JOB 22;
+---------------+
| Result        |
+---------------+
| "Job stopped" |
+---------------+
```

## RECOVER JOB

The `RECOVER JOB [<job_id>]` statement re-executes the jobs that status is `QUEUE`, `FAILED` or `STOPPED` in the current graph space and returns the number of recovered jobs. If `<job_id>` is not specified, re-execution is performed from the earliest job and the number of jobs that have been recovered is returned.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> RECOVER JOB;
+-------------------+
| Recovered job num |
+-------------------+
| 5 job recovered   |
+-------------------+
```

## FAQ

### How to troubleshoot job problems?

The `SUBMIT JOB` operations use the HTTP port. Please check if the HTTP ports on the machines where the Storage Service is running are working well. You can use the following command to debug.

```bash
curl "http://{storaged-ip}:19779/admin?space={space_name}&op=compact"
```

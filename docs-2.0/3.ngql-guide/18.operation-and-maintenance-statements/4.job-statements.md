# Job manager and the JOB statements

The long-term tasks running by the Storage Service are called jobs. For example, there are jobs for `COMPACT`, `FLUSH`, and `STATS`. These jobs can be time-consuming if the data size in the graph space is large. The job manager helps you run, show, stop, and recover the jobs.

## SUBMIT JOB COMPACT

The `SUBMIT JOB COMPACT` statement triggers the long-term RocksDB compact operation.

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB COMPACT;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 40         |
+------------+
```

For more information about compact configuration, see [Storage Service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md).

## SUBMIT JOB FLUSH

The `SUBMIT JOB FLUSH` statement writes the RocksDB memfile in memory to the hard disk.

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB FLUSH;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 96         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB STATS

The `SUBMIT JOB STATS` statement starts a job that makes the statistics of the current graph space. Once this job succeeds, you can use the `SHOW STATS` statement to list the statistics. For more information, see [SHOW STATS](../7.general-query-statements/6.show/14.show-stats.md).

>**NOTE:** If the data stored in the graph space changes, in order to get the latest statistics, you have to run `SUBMIT JOB STATS` again.

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB STATS;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 97         |
+------------+
```

## SHOW JOB

The Meta Service parses a `SUBMIT JOB` request into tasks and assigns them to the nebula-storaged processes. The `SHOW JOB <job_id>` statement shows the information about a specific job and all its tasks.

The job ID is created when you run the `SUBMIT JOB` statement.

```ngql
nebula> SHOW JOB 96;
+----------------+---------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| Job Id(TaskId) | Command(Dest) | Status     | Start Time              | Stop Time               |
+----------------+---------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 96             | "FLUSH"       | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 |
+----------------+---------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 0              | "storaged2"   | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 |
+----------------+---------------+-------------------------+------------+-------------------------+
| 1              | "storaged0"   | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 |
+----------------+---------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 2              | "storaged1"   | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 |
+----------------+---------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
```

The description of the return message is as follows.

|Column|Description|
|-|-|
|`Job Id(TaskId)`|The first row shows the job ID, and the other rows show the task IDs.|
|`Command(Dest)`|The first row shows the command executed, and the other rows show on which storaged processes the task is running.|
|`Status`|Shows the status of the job or task. For more information about job status, see [Job status](#job_status).|
|`Start Time`|Shows a timestamp indicating the time when the job or task enters the `RUNNING` phase.|
|`Stop Time`|Shows a timestamp indicating the time when the job or task gets `FINISHED`, `FAILED`, or `STOPPED`.|

### Job status

The description of the job status is as follows.

|Status|Description|
|-|-|
|QUEUE|The job or task is waiting in a queue. The `Start Time` is empty in this phase.|
|RUNNING|The job or task is running. The `Start Time` shows the beginning of this phase.|
|FINISHED|The job or task is successfully finished. The `Stop Time` shows the time when the job or task enters this phase.|
|FAILED|The job or task failed. The `Stop Time` shows the time when the job or task enters this phase.|
|STOPPED|The job or task is stopped without running. The `Stop Time` shows the time when the job or task enters this phase.|
|REMOVED|The job or task is removed.|

Status switching is described as follows.

```ngql
Queue -- running -- finished -- removed
     \          \                /
      \          \ -- failed -- /
       \          \            /
        \ ---------- stopped -/
```

## SHOW JOBS

The `SHOW JOBS` statement lists all the unexpired jobs. The default job expiration interval is one week. You can change it by modifying the `job_expired_secs` parameter of the Meta Service. For how to modify `job_expired_secs`, see [Meta Service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md).

```ngql
nebula> SHOW JOBS;
+--------+----------------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| Job Id | Command              | Status     | Start Time              | Stop Time               |
+--------+----------------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 97     | "STATS"              | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-28T14:48:52.000 | 2020-11-28T14:48:52.000 |
+--------+----------------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 96     | "FLUSH"              | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 | 2020-11-28T14:14:29.000 |
+--------+----------------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 95     | "STATS"              | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-28T13:02:11.000 | 2020-11-28T13:02:11.000 |
+--------+----------------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| 86     | "REBUILD_EDGE_INDEX" | "FINISHED" | 2020-11-26T13:38:24.000 | 2020-11-26T13:38:24.000 |
+--------+----------------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
```

### STOP JOB

The `STOP JOB` statement stops jobs that are not finished.

```ngql
nebula> STOP JOB 22;
+---------------+
| Result        |
+---------------+
| "Job stopped" |
+---------------+
```

### RECOVER JOB

The `RECOVER JOB` statement re-executes the failed jobs and returns the number of recovered jobs.

```ngql
nebula> RECOVER JOB;
+-------------------+
| Recovered job num |
+-------------------+
| 5 job recovered   |
+-------------------+
```

## FAQ

### How to troubleshoot job problems

The `SUBMIT JOB` operations use the HTTP port. Please check if the HTTP ports on the machines where the Storage Service is running are working well. You can use the following command to debug.

```bash
curl "http://{storaged-ip}:19779/admin?space={space_name}&op=compact"
```

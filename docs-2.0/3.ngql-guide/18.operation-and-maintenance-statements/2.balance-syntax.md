# BALANCE syntax

The `BALANCE` statements support the load balancing operations of the Nebula Graph Storage services. For more information about storage load balancing and examples for using the `BALANCE` statements, see [Storage load balance](../../8.service-tuning/load-balance.md).

!!! compatibility "Legacy version compatibility"

    The `BALANCE` commands is changed because the zone feature is added to Nebula Graph version 3.0.0, `BALANCE` commands before version 3.0.0 is not compatible.

The `BALANCE` statements are listed as follows.

|Syntax|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`BALANCE IN ZONE [REMOVE <ip>:<port> [,<ip>:<port> ...]]`| Starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in each zone in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. You can use the `REMOVE` option to specify the Storage services that you want to clear. The partitions of these services will be moved to other services for easy maintenance.|
|`BALANCE ACROSS ZONE [REMOVE "zone_name" [,"zone_name" ...]]`| Starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions across each zone in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. You can use the `REMOVE` option to specify the zones that you want to clear. The partitions of these services will be moved to other services for easy maintenance.|
|`BALANCE LEADER`| Starts a job to balance the distribution of storage leaders across each zone in the current graph space. It returns the job ID.|

!!! note

    `REMOVE` can only clear the partitions of the current graph space. If a Storage service has a large number of graph spaces, you need to switch to all different graph spaces to perform the `REMOVE` operation.

# Kill queries

`KILL QUERY` can terminate the query being executed, and is often used to terminate slow queries.

!!! note

    Users with the God role can kill all queries and users with other roles only can kill their own queries.

## Syntax

```ngql
KILL QUERY (session=<session_id>, plan=<plan_id>);
```

- `session_id`: The ID of the session.
- `plan_id`: The ID of the execution plan.

The ID of the session and the ID of the execution plan can uniquely determine a query. Both can be obtained through the [SHOW QUERIES](../7.general-query-statements/6.show/18.show-queries.md) statement.

## Examples

This example executes `KILL QUERY` in one session to terminate the query in another session.

```ngql
nebula> KILL QUERY(SESSION=1625553545984255,PLAN=163);
```

The query will be terminated and the following information will be returned.

```ngql
[ERROR (-1005)]: Execution had been killed
```

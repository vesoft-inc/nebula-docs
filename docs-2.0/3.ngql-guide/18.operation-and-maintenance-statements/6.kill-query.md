# Kill queries

`KILL QUERY` can terminate the query being executed, and is often used to terminate slow queries.

## Syntax

```ngql
KILL QUERY (session=<session_id>, plan=<plan_id>);
```

- `session_id`: The ID of the session.
- `plan_id`: The ID of the execution plan.

The ID of the session and the ID of the execution plan can uniquely determine a query. Both can be obtained through the [SHOW QUERIES](../7.general-query-statements/6.show/18.show-queries.md) statement.

## Examples

This example executes `KILL QUERY` in one session to terminate the query in another session.

```ngql
nebula> KILL QUERY(SESSION=1625553545984255,PLAN=163);
```

The query will be terminated and the following information will be returned.

```ngql
[ERROR (-1005)]: Execution had been killed
```

# FIND PATH

```ngql
FIND SHORTEST | ALL | NOLOOP PATH FROM <vertex_id_list> TO <vertex_id_list>
OVER <edge_type_list> [REVERSELY] [BIDIRECT] [UPTO <N> STEPS]

<vertex_id_list> ::=
    [vertex_id [, vertex_id ...]
```

The `FIND PATH` statement finds the paths between the selected source vertex and destination vertex.

- `SHORTEST` finds the shortest path.
- `ALL` finds all the paths.
- `<vertex_id_list>` is a list of vertex IDs separated by commas (,). It supports `$-` and `$var`.
- `<edge_type_list>`  is a list of edge types separated by commas (,). `*` is all edge types.
- `<N>` is the hop number. The default value is 5.

## Limitations

- When source and destination vertices are ID lists, the shortest path between any source vertices and the destination vertices is returned.
- There can be cycles when searching all paths.
- `FIND PATH` does not support property filtering.
- `FIND PATH` does not support specifying direction.
- `FIND PATH` is a single-process procedure, so it uses much memory.
- When finding path with the `NOLOOP` keyword, the returned paths do not include cycles.

## Examples

In Nebula Console, path is shown as `vertex_id <edge_name, rank> vertex_id`.

```ngql
nebula> FIND SHORTEST PATH FROM "player102" TO "team201" OVER *;
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| path                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ("player102")-[:follow@0]->("player101")-[:serve@0]->("team201") |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

```ngql
nebula> FIND SHORTEST PATH FROM "player100" TO "team200" OVER * REVERSELY;
Empty set (time spent 17442/18406 us)
```

```ngql
nebula> FIND ALL PATH FROM "player100" TO "team200" OVER *;
+---------------------------------------+
| path                                  |
+---------------------------------------+
| ("player100")-[:serve@0]->("team200") |
+---------------------------------------+
```

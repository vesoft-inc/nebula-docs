# GET SUBGRAPH

The `GET SUBGRAPH` statement retrieves information of vertices and edges reachable from the source vertices of the specified edge types and returns information of the subgraph.

## Syntax

```ngql
GET SUBGRAPH [WITH PROP] [<step_count> STEPS] FROM {<vid>, <vid>...}
[{IN | OUT | BOTH} <edge_type>, <edge_type>...]
[YIELD [VERTICES AS <vertex_alias>] [,EDGES AS <edge_alias>]];
```

- `WITH PROP` shows the properties. If not specified, the properties will be hidden.

- `step_count` specifies the number of hops from the source vertices and returns the subgraph from 0 to `step_count` hops. It must be a non-negative integer. Its default value is 1.

- `vid` specifies the vertex IDs.

- `edge_type` specifies the edge type. You can use `IN`, `OUT`, and `BOTH` to specify the traversal direction of the edge type. The default is `BOTH`.

- `YIELD` defines the output that needs to be returned. You can return only vertexes or edges. The alias must be set. When you do not use `YIELD` to define the output result, `_vertices` and `_edges` are returned by default.

!!! note

    The path type of `GET SUBGRAPH` is `trail`. Only vertices can be repeatedly visited in graph traversal. For more information, see [Path](../../1.introduction/2.1.path.md).

## Examples

The following graph is used as the sample.

![A sample graph for GET SUBGRAPH](../../2.quick-start/dataset-for-crud.png)

Insert the test data:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE SPACE IF NOT EXISTS subgraph(partition_num=15, replica_factor=1, vid_type=fixed_string(30));
nebula> USE subgraph;
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS player(name string, age int);
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS team(name string);
nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS follow(degree int);
nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS serve(start_year int, end_year int);
nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player100":("Tim Duncan", 42);
nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player101":("Tony Parker", 36);
nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player102":("LaMarcus Aldridge", 33);
nebula> INSERT VERTEX team(name) VALUES "team203":("Trail Blazers"), "team204":("Spurs");
nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player101" -> "player100":(95);
nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player101" -> "player102":(90);
nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player102" -> "player100":(75);
nebula> INSERT EDGE serve(start_year, end_year) VALUES "player101" -> "team204":(1999, 2018),"player102" -> "team203":(2006,  2015);
```

* This example goes one step from the vertex `player101` over all edge types and gets the subgraph.

    ```ngql
    nebula> GET SUBGRAPH 1 STEPS FROM "player101" YIELD VERTICES AS nodes, EDGES AS relationships;
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | nodes                                                                   | relationships                                                                                                               |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | [("player101" :player{})]                                               | [[:serve "player101"->"team204" @0 {}], [:follow "player101"->"player100" @0 {}], [:follow "player101"->"player102" @0 {}]] |
    | [("team204" :team{}), ("player100" :player{}), ("player102" :player{})] | [[:follow "player102"->"player100" @0 {}]]                                                                                  |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

    The returned subgraph is as follows.

    ![GET SUBGRAPH FROM "player101"](subgraph-1.png)

* This example goes one step from the vertex `player101` over incoming `follow` edges and gets the subgraph.

    ```ngql
    nebula> GET SUBGRAPH 1 STEPS FROM "player101" IN follow YIELD VERTICES AS nodes, EDGES AS relationships;
    +---------------------------+---------------+
    | nodes                     | relationships |
    +---------------------------+---------------+
    | [("player101" :player{})] | []            |
    | []                        | []            |
    +---------------------------+---------------+
    ```

    There is no incoming `follow` edge to `player101`, so only the vertex `player101` is returned.

* This example goes one step from the vertex `player101` over outgoing `serve` edges, gets the subgraph, and shows the property of the edge.

    ```ngql
    nebula> GET SUBGRAPH WITH PROP 1 STEPS FROM "player101" OUT serve YIELD VERTICES AS nodes, EDGES AS relationships;
    +-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | nodes                                                 | relationships                                                           |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | [("player101" :player{age: 36, name: "Tony Parker"})] | [[:serve "player101"->"team204" @0 {end_year: 2018, start_year: 1999}]] |
    | [("team204" :team{name: "Spurs"})]                    | []                                                                      |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

    The returned subgraph is as follows.

## FAQ

### Why is the number of hops in the returned result greater than `step_count`?

To show the completeness of the subgraph, an additional hop is made on all vertices that meet the conditions. The following graph is used as the sample.

![FAQ](subgraph2.png)

- The returned paths of `GET SUBGRAPH 1 STEPS FROM "A";` are `A->B`, `B->A`, and `A->C`. To show the completeness of the subgraph, an additional hop is made on all vertices that meet the conditions, namely `B->C`.

- The returned path of `GET SUBGRAPH 1 STEPS FROM "A" IN follow;` is `B->A`. To show the completeness of the subgraph, an additional hop is made on all vertices that meet the conditions, namely `A->B`.

If you only query paths or vertices that meet the conditions, we suggest you use [MATCH](../7.general-query-statements/2.match.md) or [GO](../7.general-query-statements/3.go.md). The example is as follows.

```ngql
nebula> match p= (v:player) -- (v2) where id(v)=="A" return p;

nebula> go 1 steps from "A" over follow;
```

### Why is the number of hops in the returned result lower than `step_count`?

The query stops when there is not enough subgraph data and will not return the null value.

```ngql
nebula> GET SUBGRAPH 100 STEPS FROM "player101" OUT follow YIELD VERTICES AS nodes, EDGES AS relationships;
+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| nodes                                              | relationships                                                                        |
+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| [("player101" :player{})]                          | [[:follow "player101"->"player100" @0 {}], [:follow "player101"->"player102" @0 {}]] |
| [("player100" :player{}), ("player102" :player{})] | [[:follow "player102"->"player100" @0 {}]]                                           |
+----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

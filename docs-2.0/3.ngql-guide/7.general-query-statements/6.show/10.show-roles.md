# SHOW ROLES

The `SHOW ROLES` statement shows the roles that are assigned to a user account.

The return message differs according to the role of the user who is running this statement:

* If the user is a `GOD` or `ADMIN` and is granted access to the specified graph space, NebulaGraph shows all roles in this graph space except for `GOD`.

* If the user is a `DBA`, `USER`, or `GUEST` and is granted access to the specified graph space, NebulaGraph shows the user's own role in this graph space.

* If the user does not have access to the specified graph space, NebulaGraph returns `PermissionError`.

For more information about roles, see [Roles and privileges](../../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

# SHOW STATS

The `SHOW STATS` statement shows the statistics of the graph space collected by the latest `SUBMIT JOB STATS` job.

The statistics include the following information:

* The number of vertices in the graph space
* The number of edges in the graph space
* The number of vertices of each tag
* The number of edges of each edge type

!!! warning

    The data returned by `SHOW STATS` is not real-time. The returned data is collected by the latest [SUBMIT JOB STATS](../../4.job-statements.md) job and may include [TTL-expired](../../8.clauses-and-options/ttl-options.md) data. The expired data will be deleted and not included in the statistics the next time the [Compaction operation ](../../../8.service-tuning/compaction.md) is performed.


## Prerequisites

You have to run the `SUBMIT JOB STATS` statement in the graph space where you want to collect statistics. For more information, see [SUBMIT JOB STATS](../../4.job-statements.md).

!!! caution

    The result of the `SHOW STATS` statement is based on the last executed `SUBMIT JOB STATS` statement. If you want to update the result, run `SUBMIT JOB STATS` again. Otherwise the statistics will be wrong.

# SHOW COLLATION

The `SHOW COLLATION` statement shows the collations supported by Nebula Graph.

Currently available types are: `utf8_bin`, `utf8_general_ci`, `utf8mb4_bin`, and `utf8mb4_general_ci`.

- When the character set is `utf8`, the default collate is `utf8_bin`.

- When the character set is `utf8mb4`, the default collate is `utf8mb4_bin`.

- Both `utf8mb4_bin` and `utf8mb4_general_ci` are case-insensitive.

# SHOW COLLATION

The `SHOW COLLATION` statement shows the collations supported by NebulaGraph.

Currently available types are: utf8_bin, utf8_general_ci, utf8mb4_bin, and utf8mb4_general_ci. When the character set is utf8, the default collate is utf8_bin; when the character set is utf8mb4, the default collate is utf8mb4_bin. Both utf8_general_ci and utf8mb4_general_ci are case-insensitive.

## Syntax

```ngql
SHOW COLLATION
```

## Example

```ngql
nebula> SHOW COLLATION;
+------------+---------+
| Collation  | Charset |
+------------+---------+
| "utf8_bin" | "utf8"  |
+------------+---------+
Got 1 rows (time spent 413/1034 us)

The output of `SHOW CHARSET` is described as follows:

|Column|Description|
|-|-|
|`Collation`|The collation name.|
|`Charset`|The name of the character set with which the collation is associated.|

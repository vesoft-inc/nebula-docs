# LOOKUP

<!-- This topic needs to be modified after compulsory use of YIELD in 3.0. Refer to https://confluence.nebula-graph.io/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10723963 -->

The `LOOKUP` statement traverses data based on indexes. You can use `LOOKUP` for the following purposes:

- Search for the specific data based on conditions defined by the `WHERE` clause.

- List vertices with a tag: retrieve the VID of all vertices with a tag.

- List edges with an edge type: retrieve the source vertex IDs, destination vertex IDs, and ranks of all edges with an edge type.

- Count the number of vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type.

## OpenCypher compatibility

This topic applies to native nGQL only.

## Precautions

- Correct use of indexes can speed up queries, but indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance reduction can be 90% or even more. **DO NOT** use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service.

- If the specified property is not indexed when using the `LOOKUP` statement, NebulaGraph randomly selects one of the available indexes.

  For example, the tag `player` has two properties, `name` and `age`. Both the tag `player` itself and the property `name` have indexes, but the property `age` has no indexes. When running `LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.age == 36 YIELD player.name;`, NebulaGraph randomly uses one of the indexes of the tag `player` and the property `name`.

  !!! compatibility "Legacy version compatibility"

        In the previous releases, if the specified property is not indexed when using the `LOOKUP` statement, NebulaGraph reports an error and does not use other indexes.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `LOOKUP` statement, make sure that at least one index is created. If there are already related vertices, edges, or properties before an index is created, the user must [rebuild the index](../14.native-index-statements/4.rebuild-native-index.md) after creating the index to make it valid.

## Syntax

```ngql
LOOKUP ON {<vertex_tag> | <edge_type>}
[WHERE <expression> [AND <expression> ...]]
[YIELD <return_list> [AS <alias>]];

<return_list>
    <prop_name> [AS <col_alias>] [, <prop_name> [AS <prop_alias>] ...];
```

- `WHERE <expression>`: filters data with specified conditions. Both `AND` and `OR` are supported between different expressions. For more information, see [WHERE](../8.clauses-and-options/where.md).

- `YIELD`: Define the output to be returned.

  - When you `LOOKUP` a Tag, the defined properties and `VertexID` are returned. If there is no `YIELD` clause, `VertexID` is returned.
  - When you `LOOKUP` an Edge type, the defined properties, `SrcVertexID`, `DstVertexID`, and `rank` are returned. If there is no `YIELD` clause, `SrcVertexID`, `DstVertexID`, and `rank` are returned.

- `AS`: Set an alias.

## Limitations of using `WHERE` in `LOOKUP`

The `WHERE` clause in a `LOOKUP` statement does not support the following operations:

- `$-` and `$^`.
- In relational expressions, operators are not supported to have field names on both sides, such as `tagName.prop1> tagName.prop2`.
- Nested AliasProp expressions in operation expressions and function expressions are not supported.
- The `XOR` and `NOT` operations are not supported.
<!--  - String operations other than `STARTS WITH` are not supported.-->

## Retrieve vertices

The following example returns vertices whose `name` is `Tony Parker` and the tag is `player`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS index_player ON player(name(30), age);

nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX index_player;

        WHERE player.name == "Tony Parker";

+-------------+
| "player101" |
+-------------+

nebula> LOOKUP ON player \
        WHERE player.name == "Tony Parker" \
        YIELD properties(vertex).name AS name, properties(vertex).age AS age;
+-------------+---------------+-----+

nebula> LOOKUP ON player \
        WHERE player.name STARTS WITH "B" \
        AND player.age IN [22,30] \
        YIELD properties(vertex).name, properties(vertex).age;

        WHERE player.name == "Kobe Bryant"\
        YIELD properties(vertex).name AS name |\
        GO FROM $-.VertexID OVER serve \
        YIELD $-.name, properties(edge).start_year, properties(edge).end_year, properties($$).name;

## Retrieve edges

The following example returns edges whose `degree` is `90` and the edge type is `follow`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS index_follow ON follow(degree);

nebula> REBUILD EDGE INDEX index_follow;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 62         |
+------------+

nebula> LOOKUP ON follow \
        WHERE follow.degree == 90;
+-------------+-------------+---------+
| SrcVID      | DstVID      | Ranking |
+-------------+-------------+---------+
| "player150" | "player143" | 0       |
| "player150" | "player137" | 0       |
| "player148" | "player136" | 0       |
...

nebula> LOOKUP ON follow \
        WHERE follow.degree == 90 \
        YIELD properties(edge).degree;
+-------------+-------------+---------+-------------------------+
| SrcVID      | DstVID      | Ranking | properties(EDGE).degree |
+-------------+-------------+---------+-------------------------+
| "player150" | "player143" | 0       | 90                      |

| "player148" | "player136" | 0       | 90                      |
...

nebula> LOOKUP ON follow \
        WHERE follow.degree == 60 \
        YIELD properties(edge).degree AS Degree |\
        GO FROM $-.DstVID OVER serve \
        YIELD $-.DstVID, properties(edge).start_year, properties(edge).end_year, properties($$).name;
+-------------+------------------+----------------+--------------+
| $-.DstVID   | serve.start_year | serve.end_year | $$.team.name |

## List vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type

To list vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type, at least one index must exist on the tag, the edge type, or its property.

For example, if there is a `player` tag with a `name` property and an `age` property, to retrieve the VID of all vertices tagged with `player`, there has to be an index on the `player` tag itself, the `name` property, or the `age` property.

- The following example shows how to retrieve the VID of all vertices tagged with `player`.

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS player(name string,age int);

    nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS player_index on player();

    nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX player_index;
    +------------+
    | New Job Id |
    +------------+
    | 66         |
    +------------+

    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) \
            VALUES "player100":("Tim Duncan", 42), "player101":("Tony Parker", 36);

    The following statement retrieves the VID of all vertices with the tag `player`. It is similar to `MATCH (n:player) RETURN id(n) /*, n */`.

    nebula> LOOKUP ON player;
    +-------------+
    |  VertexID   |
    +-------------+
    | "player100" |
    | "player101" |
    +-------------+
    ```

- The following example shows how to retrieve the source Vertex IDs, destination vertex IDs, and ranks of all edges of the `follow` edge type.

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE EDGE IF NOT EXISTS follow(degree int);

    nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS follow_index on follow();

    nebula> REBUILD EDGE INDEX follow_index;
    +------------+
    | New Job Id |
    +------------+
    | 88         |
    +------------+

    nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) \
            VALUES "player100"->"player101":(95);

    The following statement retrieves all edges with the edge type `follow`. It is similar to `MATCH (s)-[e:follow]->(d) RETURN id(s), rank(e), id(d) /*, type(e) */`.

    nebula)> LOOKUP ON follow;
    +-------------+-------------+---------+
    | SrcVID      | DstVID      | Ranking |
    +-------------+-------------+---------+
    | "player100" | "player101" | 0       |
    +-------------+-------------+---------+
    ```

## Count the numbers of vertices or edges

The following example shows how to count the number of vertices tagged with `player` and edges of the `follow` edge type.

```ngql
nebula> LOOKUP ON player |\
        YIELD COUNT(*) AS Player_Number;
+---------------+
| Player_Number |
+---------------+
| 51            |
+---------------+

nebula> LOOKUP ON follow | \
        YIELD COUNT(*) AS Follow_Number;
+---------------+
| Follow_Number |
+---------------+
| 81            |
+---------------+
```

!!! note

    You can also use [`SHOW STATS`](./6.show/14.show-stats.md) to count the numbers of vertices or edges.

# UNWIND

The `UNWIND` statement splits a list into separated rows.

`UNWIND` can function as an individual statement or a clause in a statement.

## Syntax

```ngql
UNWIND <list> AS <alias> <RETURN clause>;
```

## Split a list

The following example splits the list `[1,2,3]` into three rows.

```ngql
nebula> UNWIND [1,2,3] AS n RETURN n;
+---+
| n |
+---+
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
+---+
```

## Return a list with distinct items

Use `WITH DISTINCT` in the `UNWIND` statement to return a list with distinct items.

### Example 1

The following statement:

1. Splits the list `[1,1,2,2,3,3]` into rows.
2. Removes duplicated rows.
3. Sorts the rows.
4. Transforms the rows to a list.

```ngql
nebula> WITH [1,1,2,2,3,3] AS n \
        UNWIND n AS r \
        WITH DISTINCT r AS r \
        ORDER BY r \
        RETURN collect(r);
+------------+
| collect(r) |
+------------+
| [1, 2, 3]  |
+------------+
```

## Example 2

The following statement:

1. Outputs the vertices on the matched path into a list.
2. Splits the list into rows.
3. Removes duplicated rows.
4. Transforms the rows to a list.

```ngql
nebula> MATCH p=(v:player{name:"Tim Duncan"})--(v2) \
        WITH nodes(p) AS n \
        UNWIND n AS r \
        WITH DISTINCT r AS r \
        RETURN collect(r);

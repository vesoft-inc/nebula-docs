# List

List is a composite data type. A composite data type cannot be stored as properties. List is a sequence of values. Individual list elements can be accessed by their positions.

A list starts with a left square bracket `[` and ends with a right square bracket `]`. List contains zero, one or more expressions. List elements are separated from each other with a comma `,`. Whitespace around elements is ignored in list, thus line breaks, tab stops, and blanks can be used for formatting.

## Examples

```ngql
[]
[1, 2, 3]
```

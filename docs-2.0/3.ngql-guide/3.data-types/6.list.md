# Lists

The list is a composite data type. A list is a sequence of values. Individual elements in a list can be accessed by their positions.

A list starts with a left square bracket `[` and ends with a right square bracket `]`. A list contains zero, one, or more expressions. List elements are separated from each other with commas (`,`). Whitespace around elements is ignored in the list, thus line breaks, tab stops, and blanks can be used for formatting.

## OpenCypher compatibility

A composite data type (i.e. set, map, and list) **CANNOT** be stored as properties of vertices or edges.

## List operations

You can use the preset [list function](../6.functions-and-expressions/6.list.md) to operate the list, or use the index to filter the elements in the list.

### Index syntax

```ngql
[M]
[M..N]
[M..]
[..N]
```

The index of nGQL supports queries from front to back, starting from 0. 0 means the first element, 1 means the second element, and so on. It also supports queries from back to front, starting from -1. -1 means the last element, -2 means the penultimate element, and so on.

- [M]: represents the element whose index is M.
- [M..N]: represents the elements whose indexes are `greater or equal to M but smaller than N`. Return empty when `N` is 0.
- [M..]: represents the elements whose indexes are `greater or equal to M`.
- [..N]: represents the elements whose indexes are `smaller than N`. Return empty when `N` is 0.

!!! note

    - Return empty if the index is out of bounds, while return normally if the index is within the bound.
    - Return empty if `M`≥`N`.
    - When querying a single element, if `M` is null, return `BAD_TYPE`. When conducting a range query, if `M` or `N` is null, return `null`.

## OpenCypher compatibility

- In openCypher, return `null` when querying a single out-of-bound element. However, in nGQL, return `OUT_OF_RANGE` when querying a single out-of-bound element.

    ```ngql
    nebula> RETURN range(0,5)[-12];
    +-------------------+
    | range(0,5)[-(12)] |
    +-------------------+
    | OUT_OF_RANGE      |
    +-------------------+
    ```

- A composite data type (i.e., set, map, and list) **CAN NOT** be stored as properties for vertices or edges.

  It is recommended to modify the graph modeling method. The composite data type should be modeled as an adjacent edge of a vertex, rather than its property. Each adjacent edge can be dynamically added or deleted. The rank values of the adjacent edges can be used for sequencing.

- Patterns are not supported in the list. For example, `[(src)-[]->(m) | m.name]`.

# Lists

List is a composite data type. List is a sequence of values. Individual list elements can be accessed by their positions.

> **openCypher Incompatible:** A composite data type (i.e. set, map, and list) cannot be stored as (vertex's or edge's) properties.

A list starts with a left square bracket `[` and ends with a right square bracket `]`. A list contains zero, one, or more expressions. List elements are separated from each other with a comma `,`. Whitespace around elements is ignored in list, thus line breaks, tab stops, and blanks can be used for formatting.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> YIELD [1, 2, 3] AS List;
+-----------+
| List      |
+-----------+
| [1, 2, 3] |
+-----------+

nebula> YIELD range(1,5)[3];
+---------------+
| range(1,5)[3] |
+---------------+
| 4             |
+---------------+

nebula> YIELD range(1,5)[-2];
+------------------+
| range(1,5)[-(2)] |
+------------------+
| 4                |
+------------------+

nebula> YIELD [n IN range(1,5) WHERE n > 2] AS a;
+-----------+
| a         |
+-----------+
| [3, 4, 5] |
+-----------+

nebula> YIELD [n IN range(1,5) WHERE n > 2 | n + 10] AS a;
+--------------+
| a            |
+--------------+
| [13, 14, 15] |
+--------------+

nebula> YIELD [n IN range(1,5) | n + 10] AS a;
+----------------------+
| a                    |
+----------------------+
| [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] |
+----------------------+

nebula> YIELD tail([n IN range(1, 5) | 2 * n - 10]) AS a;
+-----------------+
| a               |
+-----------------+
| [-6, -4, -2, 0] |
+-----------------+

nebula> YIELD [n IN range(1, 3) WHERE true | n] AS r;
+-----------+
| r         |
+-----------+
| [1, 2, 3] |
+-----------+

nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow WHERE follow.degree NOT IN [x IN [92, 90] | x + $$.player.age] \
        YIELD follow._dst AS id, follow.degree AS degree;
+-------------+--------+
| id          | degree |
+-------------+--------+
| "player101" | 95     |
+-------------+--------+
| "player102" | 90     |
+-------------+--------+

nebula> MATCH p = (n:player{name:"Tim Duncan"})-[:follow]->(m) \
                -> RETURN [n IN nodes(p) | n.age + 100] AS r;
+------------+
| r          |
+------------+
| [142, 136] |
+------------+
| [142, 133] |
+------------+

nebula> YIELD size([1,2,3]);
+---------------+
| size([1,2,3]) |
+---------------+
| 3             |
+---------------+
```

## openCypher compatibility

TODO(incompatible)
<!--
List has many incompatible with openCypher. Refer to github.

At this time, NebulaÂ Graph does not support using ranges inside the brackets to return ranges of the list.

```ngql
nebula> YIELD range(0,5)[0..3];
[ERROR (-7)]: SyntaxError: syntax error near `3]'
```

In openCypher, out-of-bound single elements returns `null`. However, in nGQL, out-of-bound single elements returns `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

```ngql
nebula> YIELD range(0,5)[-12];
+-------------------+
| range(0,5)[-(12)] |
+-------------------+
| OUT_OF_RANGE      |
+-------------------+
```

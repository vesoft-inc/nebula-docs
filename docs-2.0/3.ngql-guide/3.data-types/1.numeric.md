# Numeric types

nGQL supports both integer and floating-point number.

## Integer

Signed 64-bit integer (INT64), 32-bit integer (INT32), 16-bit integer (INT16), and 8-bit integer (INT8) are supported.

| Type | Declared keywords | Range |
|-|-|-|
| INT64 | `INT64` or`INT` | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 ~ 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| INT32 | `INT32` | -2,147,483,648 ~ 2,147,483,647 |
| INT16 | `INT16` | -32,768 ~ 32,767 |
| INT8 | `INT8` | -128 ~ 127 |

## Floating-point number

Both single-precision floating-point format (FLOAT) and double-precision floating-point format (DOUBLE) are supported.

| Type | Declared keywords | Range | Precision |
|-|-|-|-|
| FLOAT | `FLOAT` | 3.4E +/- 38 | 6~7 bits |
| DOUBLE | `DOUBLE` | 1.7E +/- 308 | 15~16 bits |

Scientific notation is also supported, such as `1e2`, `1.1e2`, `.3e4`, `1.e4`, and `-1234E-10`.

!!! note

    The data type of DECIMAL in MySQL is not supported.

## Reading and writing of data values

When writing and reading different types of data, nGQL complies with the following rules:

| Data type | Set as VID | Set as property | Resulted data type |
|-|-|-|-|
| INT64 | Supported | Supported | INT64 |
| INT32 | Not supported | Supported | INT64 |
| INT16 | Not supported | Supported | INT64 |
| INT8 | Not supported| Supported | INT64 |
| FLOAT | Not supported | Supported | DOUBLE |
| DOUBLE | Not supported | Supported | DOUBLE |

For example, nGQL does not support setting [VID](../../1.introduction/3.vid.md) as INT8, but supports setting a certain property type of [TAG](../10.tag-statements/1.create-tag.md) or [Edge type](../11.edge-type-statements/1.create-edge.md) as INT8. When using the nGQL statement to read the property of INT8, the resulted type is INT64.

- Multiple formats are supported:

  - Decimal, such as `123456`.
  - Hexadecimal, such as `0x1e240`.
  - Octal, such as `0361100`.

  However, Nebula Graph will parse the written non-decimal value into a decimal value and save it. The value read is decimal.

  For example, the type of the property `score` is `INT`. The value of `0xb` is assigned to it through the INSERT statement. If querying the property value with statements such as FETCH, you will get the result `11`, which is the decimal result of the hexadecimal `0xb`.

- Round a FLOAT/DOUBLE value when inserting it to an INT column.

# String

The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). The literal constant is a sequence of characters of any length surrounded by double or single quotes. Line breaks are not allowed in a string. For example `"Shaquile O'Neal"` or `'"This is a double-quoted literal string"'`. Embedded escape sequences are supported within strings, for example:

- `"\n\t\r\b\f"`
- `"\110ello world"`

# String

The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). The literal constant is a sequence of characters of any length surrounded by double or single quotes. For example `"Shaquille O'Neal"` or `'"This is a double-quoted literal string"'`. Line breaks are not allowed in a string. Embedded escape sequences are supported within strings, for example:

- `"\n\t\r\b\f"`
- `"\110ello world"`

NebulaÂ Graph supports two kind of strings: fixed length string and variable length string. For example:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG t1 (p1 FIXED_STRING(10)); -- Fixed length string type

nebula> CREATE TAG t2 (p2 string); -- Variable length string type
```

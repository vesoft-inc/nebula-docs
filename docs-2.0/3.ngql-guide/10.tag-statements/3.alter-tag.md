# ALTER TAG

```ngql
ALTER TAG <tag_name>
    <alter_definition> [, alter_definition] ...]
    [ttl_definition [, ttl_definition] ... ]

alter_definition:
| ADD    (prop_name data_type)
| DROP   (prop_name)
| CHANGE (prop_name data_type)

ttl_definition:
    TTL_DURATION = ttl_duration, TTL_COL = prop_name
```

> **NOTE:** After the alteration of a tag, wait 20 seconds before inserting vertices with the tag.

`ALTER TAG` alters the structure of a tag with the given name in a graph space. You must have the `ALTER` privilege for the graph space. (TODO: privilege doc) To alter a tag in a specific graph space, you must use the graph space first.

You can add or drop properties, change the data type of an existing property. You can also set TTL (Time-To-Live) for a property, or change the TTL duration. `TTL_COL` only supports the properties whose values are of the `INT` or the `TIMESTAMP` type.

Before you alter properties for a tag, make sure that the properties are not indexed. If the properties contain any indexes, a conflict error occurs when you alter them.

For information about index, see [Index](../14.native-index-statements/1.create-native-index.md).

Multiple `ADD`, `DROP`, and `CHANGE` clauses are permitted in a single `ALTER` statement, separated by commas.

## Tag name

- `tag_name`: Specifies the tag name that you want to alter. You can alter only one tag in one statement. Before you alter a tag, make sure that the tag exists in the graph space. If the tag does not exist, an error occurs when you alter it.

## Example

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG t1 (p1 string, p2 int);
nebula> ALTER TAG t1 ADD (p3 int, p4 string);
nebula> ALTER TAG t1 TTL_DURATION = 2, TTL_COL = "p2";
```

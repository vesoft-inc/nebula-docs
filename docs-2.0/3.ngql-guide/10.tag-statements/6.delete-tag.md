# DELETE TAG

`DELETE TAG` deletes a tag with the given name on a specified vertex.

!!! enterpriseonly

    This feature is supported by the Enterprise Edition only.

A vertex can have one or more tags.

- If a vertex has only one tag, the vertex **CANNOT** be accessed after you delete the tag. But its edges are available. The vertex will be deleted in the next compaction.

- If a vertex has multiple tags, the vertex is still accessible after you delete one of them. But all the properties defined by this deleted tag **CANNOT** be accessed.

## Prerequisites

Running the `DELETE TAG` statement requires some [privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md) for the graph space. Otherwise, Nebula Graph throws an error.

## Syntax

```ngql
DELETE TAG <tag_name_list> FROM <VID>;
```

- `tag_name_list`: Specifies the name of the tag. Multiple tags are separated with commas (,). `*` means all tags.

- `VID`: Specifies the VID of the tag to delete.

## Example

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG test1(p1 string, p2 int);
nebula> CREATE TAG test2(p3 string, p4 int);
nebula> INSERT VERTEX test1(p1, p2),test2(p3, p4) VALUES "test":("123", 1, "456", 2);
nebula> FETCH PROP ON * "test";
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| vertices_                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ("test" :test2{p3: "456", p4: 2} :test1{p1: "123", p2: 1}) |
+------------------------------------------------------------+

nebula> DELETE TAG test1 FROM "test";
nebula> FETCH PROP ON * "test";
+-----------------------------------+
| vertices_                         |
+-----------------------------------+
| ("test" :test2{p3: "456", p4: 2}) |
+-----------------------------------+

nebula> DELETE TAG * FROM "test";
nebula> FETCH PROP ON * "test";
+-----------+
| vertices_ |
+-----------+
+-----------+
```

!!! Compatibility

    * In openCypher, you can use the statement `REMOVE v:LABEL` to delete the tag `LABLE` of the vertex `v`.
    * `DELETE TAG` and `DROP TAG` have the same semantics but different syntax. In nGQL, use `DELETE TAG`.

# SHOW TAGS

```ngql
SHOW TAGS
```

`SHOW TAGS` shows all tags in the current graph space. You do not need any privileges for the graph space to run this statement. But the returned results are different based on your account authentication. (TODO: privilege doc) To show tags in a specific graph space, you must use the graph space first.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> SHOW TAGS;
+----------+
| Name     |
+----------+
| "player" |
+----------+
| "team"   |
+----------+

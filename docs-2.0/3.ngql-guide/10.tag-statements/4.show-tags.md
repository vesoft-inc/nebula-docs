# SHOW TAGS

```ngql
SHOW TAGS
```

`SHOW TAGS` shows all tags in the current graph space. You do not need any privileges for the graph space to run this statement. But the returned results are different based on [role privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md). To show tags in a specific graph space, you must use the graph space first.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> SHOW TAGS;
+----------+
| Name     |
+----------+
| "player" |
+----------+
| "team"   |
+----------+

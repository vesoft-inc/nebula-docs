# SHOW TAGS

The `SHOW TAGS` statement shows the name of all tags in the current graph space.

You do not need any privileges for the graph space to run the `SHOW TAGS` statement. But the returned results are different based on [role privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

## Syntax

```ngql
SHOW TAGS;
```

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> SHOW TAGS;
+----------+
| Name     |
+----------+
| "player" |
+----------+
| "team"   |
+----------+
```

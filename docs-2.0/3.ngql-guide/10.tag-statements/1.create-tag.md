# CREATE TAG

`CREATE TAG` creates a tag with the given name in a graph space.

## OpenCypher compatibility

Tags in nGQL are similar to labels in openCypher. But they are also quite different. For example, the ways to create them are different.

* In openCypher, labels are created together with vertices in `CREATE` statements.
* In nGQL, tags are created separately using `CREATE TAG` statements. Tags in nGQL are more like tables in MySQL.

## Prerequisites

Running the `CREATE TAG` statement requires some [privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md) for the graph space. Otherwise, NebulaGraph throws an error.

## Syntax

To create a tag in a specific graph space, you must specify the current working space with the `USE` statement.

```ngql
CREATE TAG [IF NOT EXISTS] <tag_name>
    (
      <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']
      [{, <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']} ...] 
    )
    [TTL_DURATION = <ttl_duration>]
    [TTL_COL = <prop_name>]
    [COMMENT = '<comment>'];
```

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`IF NOT EXISTS`|Detects if the tag that you want to create exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The tag existence detection here only compares the tag names (excluding properties).|
|`<tag_name>`|1. Each tag name in the graph space must be **unique**. <br>2. Tag names cannot be modified after they are set.<br>3. Tag names cannot start with a number; they support 1-4 byte UTF-8 encoded characters, including English letters (case sensitive), numbers, Chinese characters, etc., but do not support special characters other than underscores. To use special characters, reserved keywords, or start with a number in a tag name, enclose them in backticks (\`), and do not use periods (`.`) in a tag name. For more information, see [Keywords and reserved words](../../3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/keywords-and-reserved-words.md). **Note**: If you name a tag in Chinese and encounter a `SyntaxError`, you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (\`).|
|`<prop_name>`|The name of the property. It must be unique for each tag. The rules for permitted property names are the same as those for tag names.|
|`<data_type>`|Shows the data type of each property. For a full description of the property data types, see [Data types](../3.data-types/1.numeric.md) and [Boolean](../3.data-types/2.boolean.md).|
|`NULL \| NOT NULL`|Specifies if the property supports `NULL | NOT NULL`. The default value is `NULL`. |
|`DEFAULT`|Specifies a default value for a property. The default value can be a literal value or an expression supported by NebulaGraph. If no value is specified, the default value is used when inserting a new vertex.|
|`COMMENT`|The remarks of a certain property or the tag itself. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on a tag.|
|`TTL_DURATION`|Specifies the life cycle for the property. The property that exceeds the specified TTL expires. The expiration threshold is the `TTL_COL` value plus the `TTL_DURATION`. The default value of `TTL_DURATION` is `0`. It means the data never expires.|
|`TTL_COL`|Specifies the property to set a timeout on. The data type of the property must be `int` or `timestamp`. A tag can only specify one field as `TTL_COL`. For more information on TTL, see [TTL options](../8.clauses-and-options/ttl-options.md).|

### Examples

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS player(name string, age int);

# The following example creates a tag with no properties.
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS no_property();Â 

# The following example creates a tag with a default value.
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS player_with_default(name string, age int DEFAULT 20);

# In the following example, the TTL of the create_time field is set to be 100 seconds.
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS woman(name string, age int, \
        married bool, salary double, create_time timestamp) \
        TTL_DURATION = 100, TTL_COL = "create_time";
```

## Implementation of the operation

Trying to use a newly created tag may fail because the creation of the tag is implemented asynchronously. To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds.

To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` parameter in the [configuration files](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) for all services.

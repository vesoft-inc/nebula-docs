# CASE expressions

The `CASE` expression uses conditions to filter the result of an nGQL query statement. It is usually used in the `YIELD` or `RETURN` clause. nGQL provides two forms of `CASE` expressions just like openCypher: the simple form and the generic form.

The `CASE` expression goes through conditions and returns a result when the first condition is met. Then the `CASE` expression stops reading the conditions and returns the result. If no conditions are met, it returns the result in the `ELSE` clause. If there is no `ELSE` clause and no conditions are met, it returns `NULL`.

The following graph is used for the examples in this topic.

## The simple form of CASE expressions

### Syntax

```nGQL
CASE <comparer>
WHEN <value> THEN <result>
[WHEN ...]
[ELSE <default>]
END
```

> **CAUTION:** Always remember to end a `CASE` expression with `END`.

|Parameters|Description|
|-|-|
|`comparer`|A value or a valid expression that outputs a value. This value is used to compare with `value`.|
|`value`|It will be compared with `comparer`. If they match, then this condition is met.|
|`result`|It is returned by the `CASE` expression if `value` matches `comparer`.|
|`default`|It is returned by the `CASE` expression if no conditions are met.|

### Examples

* Example 1:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> YIELD \
         -> CASE 2+3 \
         -> WHEN 4 THEN 0 \
         -> WHEN 5 THEN 1 \
         -> ELSE -1 \
         -> END \
         -> AS result;
    +--------+
    | result |
    +--------+
    | 1      |
    +--------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 188/583 us)
    ```

* Example 2:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
         -> YIELD $$.player.name AS Name, \
         -> CASE $$.player.age > 35 \
         -> WHEN true THEN "Yes" \
         -> WHEN false THEN "No" \
         -> ELSE "Nah" \
         -> END \
         -> AS Age_above_35;
    +---------------------+--------------+
    | Name                | Age_above_35 |
    +---------------------+--------------+
    | "Tony Parker"       | "Yes"        |
    +---------------------+--------------+
    | "LaMarcus Aldridge" | "No"         |
    +---------------------+--------------+
    Got 2 rows (time spent 3910/4348 us)
    ```

## The generic form of CASE expressions

### Syntax

```nGQL
CASE
WHEN <condition> THEN <result>
[WHEN ...]
[ELSE <default>]
END
```

|Parameters|Description|
|-|-|
|`condition`|If `condition` is evaluated as true, `result` is returned by the `CASE` expression.|
|`result`|It is returned by the `CASE` expression if `condition` is evaluated as true.|
|`default`|It is returned by the `CASE` expression if no conditions are met.|

### Examples

* Example 1:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> YIELD \
         -> CASE WHEN 4 > 5 THEN 0 \
         -> WHEN 3+4==7 THEN 1 \
         -> ELSE 2 \
         -> END \
         -> AS result;
    +--------+
    | result |
    +--------+
    | 1      |
    +--------+
    Got 1 rows (time spent 233/693 us)
    ```

* Example 2:

    ```nGQL
    nebula> MATCH (v:player) WHERE v.age > 30 \
         -> RETURN v.name AS Name,  \
         -> CASE \
         -> WHEN v.name STARTS WITH "T" THEN "Yes" \
         -> ELSE "No" \
         -> END \
         -> AS Starts_with_T;
    +---------------------+---------------+
    | Name                | Starts_with_T |
    +---------------------+---------------+
    | "Tim"               | "Yes"         |
    +---------------------+---------------+
    | "LaMarcus Aldridge" | "No"          |
    +---------------------+---------------+
    | "Tony Parker"       | "Yes"         |
    +---------------------+---------------+
    Got 3 rows (time spent 3859/4326 us)
    ```

## Differences between the simple form and the generic form

To avoid the misuse of the simple form and the generic form, it is important to understand their differences. The following example can help explain them.

```nGQL
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
     -> YIELD $$.player.name AS Name, $$.player.age AS Age, \
     -> CASE $$.player.age \
     -> WHEN $$.player.age > 35 THEN "Yes" \
     -> ELSE "No" \
     -> END \
     -> AS Age_above_35;
+---------------------+-----+--------------+
| Name                | Age | Age_above_35 |
+---------------------+-----+--------------+
| "Tony Parker"       | 36  | "No"         |
+---------------------+-----+--------------+
| "LaMarcus Aldridge" | 33  | "No"         |
+---------------------+-----+--------------+
Got 2 rows (time spent 2170/2642 us)
```

The preceding `GO` query is intended to output "Yes" when the player age is above 35. However, in this example, when the player age is 36, the actual output is not as expected: It is "No" instead of "Yes".

This is because the query uses the `CASE` expression in the simple form, and a comparison between the values of `$$.player.age` and `$$.player.age > 35` is made. When the player age is 36:

* The value of `$$.player.age` is `36`. It is an integer.
* `$$.player.age > 35` is evaluated to `true`. It is a boolean.

The values of `$$.player.age` and `$$.player.age > 35` do not match. This condition is not met and "No" is returned.

# SHOW EDGES

```ngql
SHOW EDGES
```

`SHOW EDGES` shows all edge types in the current graph space. You do not need any privileges for the graph space to run this statement. But the returned results are different based on [role privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).  To show edge types in a specific graph space, you must use the graph space first.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> SHOW EDGES;
+----------+
| Name     |
+----------+
| "follow" |
+----------+
| "serve"  |
+----------+

# SHOW EDGES

`SHOW EDGES` shows all edge types in the current graph space.

You do not need any privileges for the graph space to run the `SHOW EDGES` statement. But the returned results are different based on [role privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

## Syntax

```ngql
SHOW EDGES;
```

## Example

```ngql
nebula> SHOW EDGES;
+----------+
| Name     |
+----------+
| "follow" |
+----------+
| "serve"  |
+----------+
```

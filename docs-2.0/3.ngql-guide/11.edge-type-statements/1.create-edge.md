# CREATE EDGE

`CREATE EDGE` creates an edge type with the given name in a graph space.

## OpenCypher compatibility

Edge types in nGQL are similar to relationship types in openCypher. But they are also quite different. For example, the ways to create them are different.

* In openCypher, relationship types are created together with vertices in `CREATE` statements.
* In nGQL, edge types are created separately using `CREATE EDGE` statements. Edge types in nGQL are more like tables in MySQL.

## Prerequisites

Running the `CREATE EDGE` statement requires some [privileges](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md) for the graph space. Otherwise, Nebula Graph throws an error.

## Syntax

To create an edge type in a specific graph space, you must specify the current working space with the `USE` statement.

```ngql
CREATE EDGE [IF NOT EXISTS] <edge_type_name>
    (
      <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']
      [{, <prop_name> <data_type> [NULL | NOT NULL] [DEFAULT <default_value>] [COMMENT '<comment>']} ...] 
    )
    [TTL_DURATION = <ttl_duration>]
    [TTL_COL = <prop_name>]
    [COMMENT = '<comment>'];
```

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`IF NOT EXISTS`|Detects if the edge type that you want to create exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The edge type existence detection here only compares the edge type names (excluding properties).|
|`<edge_type_name>`|The edge type name must be **unique** in a graph space. Once the edge type name is set, it can not be altered. The rules for permitted edge type names are the same as those for graph space names. For prohibited names, see [Keywords and reserved words](../../3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/keywords-and-reserved-words.md).|
|`<prop_name>`|The name of the property. It must be unique for each edge type. The rules for permitted property names are the same as those for edge type names.|
|`<data_type>`|Shows the data type of each property. For a full description of the property data types, see [Data types](../3.data-types/1.numeric.md) and [Boolean](../3.data-types/2.boolean.md).|
|`NULL \| NOT NULL`|Specifies if the property supports `NULL | NOT NULL`. The default value is `NULL`.|
|`DEFAULT`|Specifies a default value for a property. The default value can be a literal value or an expression supported by Nebula Graph. If no value is specified, the default value is used when inserting a new edge.|
|`COMMENT`|The remarks of a certain property or the edge type itself. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on an edge type.|
|`TTL_DURATION`|Specifies the life cycle for the property. The property that exceeds the specified TTL expires. The expiration threshold is the `TTL_COL` value plus the `TTL_DURATION`. The default value of `TTL_DURATION` is `0`. It means the data never expires.|
|`TTL_COL`|Specifies the property to set a timeout on. The data type of the property must be `int` or `timestamp`. An edge type can only specify one field as `TTL_COL`. For more information on TTL, see [TTL options](../8.clauses-and-options/ttl-options.md).|

### Examples

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int);

# The following example creates an edge type with no properties.
nebula> CREATE EDGE no_property();

# The following example creates an edge type with a default value.
nebula> CREATE EDGE follow_with_default(degree int DEFAULT 20);

# In the following example, the TTL of the p2 field is set to be 100 seconds.
nebula> CREATE EDGE e1(p1 string, p2 int, p3 timestamp) \
        TTL_DURATION = 100, TTL_COL = "p2";
```

## Implementation of the operation

Trying to use a newly created edge type may fail because the creation of the edge type is implemented asynchronously.

Nebula Graph implements the creation of the edge type in the next heartbeat cycle. To make sure the creation is successful, take the following approaches:

- Find the new edge type in the result of [`SHOW EDGES`](4.show-edges.md). If you cannot, wait a few seconds and try again.

- Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds.

To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` parameter in the [configuration files](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) for all services.

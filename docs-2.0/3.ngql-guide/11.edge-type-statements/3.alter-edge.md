# ALTER EDGE

```ngql
ALTER EDGE <edge_type_name>
    <alter_definition> [, alter_definition] ...]
    [ttl_definition [, ttl_definition] ... ]

alter_definition:
| ADD    (prop_name data_type)
| DROP   (prop_name)
| CHANGE (prop_name data_type)

ttl_definition:
    TTL_DURATION = ttl_duration, TTL_COL = prop_name
```

`ALTER EDGE` alters the structure of an edge type with the given name in a graph space. You must have the `ALTER` [privilege](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md) for the graph space. To alter an edge type in a specific graph space, you must use the graph space first.

You can add or drop properties, change the data type of an existing property. You can also set TTL (Time-To-Live) for a property, or change the TTL duration. `TTL_COL` only supports `INT` or `TIMESTAMP` type properties.

Before you alter properties for an edge type, make sure that the properties are not indexed. If the properties contain any indexes, a conflict error occurs when you alter them.

For information about index, see [Index](../14.native-index-statements/1.create-native-index.md).

Multiple `ADD`, `DROP`, and `CHANGE` clauses are permitted in a single `ALTER` statement, separated by commas.

## Edge type name

`edge_type_name` specifies the edge type name that you want to alter. You can alter only one edge type in one statement. Before you alter an edge type, make sure that the edge type exists in the graph space. If the edge type does not exist, an error occurs when you alter it.

## Example

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE e1(p1 string, p2 int);
nebula> ALTER EDGE e1 ADD (p3 int, p4 string);
nebula> ALTER EDGE e1 TTL_DURATION = 2, TTL_COL = "p2";
```

## Implementation of the operation

Nebula Graph implements the alteration asynchronously in the next heartbeat cycle. Before the process finishes, the alteration does not take effect. To make sure the alteration is successful, take the following approaches:

- Use [`DESCRIBE EDGE`](5.describe-edge.md) to confirm that the edge information is updated. If it is not, wait a few seconds and try again.
- Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds.

To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` parameter in the [configuration files](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) for all services.

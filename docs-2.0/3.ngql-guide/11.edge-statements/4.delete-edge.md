# DELETE EDGE

```ngql
DELETE EDGE <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] [, <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] ...]
```

Use `DELETE EDGE` to delete edges. The `DELETE EDGE` statement deletes one edge or multiple edges at a time. You can use `DELETE EDGE` together with pipe. For more information about pipe, see [Pipe operator](../5.operators/4.pipe.md).

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> DELETE EDGE serve "player100" -> "team200";
```

This query deletes the serve edge from "player100" to "team200".

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD follow._src AS src, follow._dst AS dst, follow._rank AS rank | \
DELETE EDGE follow $-.src->$-.dst @ $-.rank;
```

This query shows that you can use `DELETE EDGE` together with pipe.

# CLEAR SPACE

`CLEAR SPACE` deletes the vertices and edges in a graph space, but does not delete the graph space itself and the schema information.

## Permission requirements

Only the [God role](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md) has the permission to run `CLEAR SPACE`.

## Caution

- Once cleared, the data **CANNOT be recovered**. Use `CLEAR SPACE` with caution.
- `CLEAR SPACE` is not an atomic operation. If an error occurs, re-run `CLEAR SPACE` to avoid data remaining.
- The larger the amount of data in the graph space, the longer it takes to clear it. If the execution fails due to client connection timeout, increase the value of the `storage_client_timeout_ms` parameter in the [Graph Service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/3.graph-config.md).
- During the execution of `CLEAR SPACE`, writing data into the graph space is not automatically prohibited. Such write operations can result in incomplete data clearing, and the residual data can be damaged.

  !!! enterpriseonly

      - The NebulaGraph Community Edition does not support blocking data writing while allowing `CLEAR SPACE`.
      - The NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition supports blocking data writing by setting `VARIABLE read_only=true` before running `CLEAR SPACE`. After the data are cleared successfully, run `SET VARIABLE read_only=false` to allow data writing again.

## Syntax

```ngql
CLEAR SPACE [IF EXISTS] <space_name>;
```

| Parameter/Option | Description |
| - | - |
| `IF EXISTS` | Check whether the graph space to be cleared exists. If it exists, continue to clear it. If it does not exist, the execution finishes, and a message indicating that the execution succeeded is displayed. <br/>If `IF EXISTS` is not set and the graph space does not exist, the `CLEAR SPACE` statement fails to execute, and an error occurs. |
|`space_name`| The name of the space to be cleared. |

Example:

```ngql
CLEAR SPACE basketballplayer;
```

## Data reserved

`CLEAR SPACE` does not delete the following data in a graph space:

- Tag information.
- Edge type information.
- The metadata of native indexes and full-text indexes.

The following example shows what `CLEAR SPACE` deletes and reserves.

```ngql
# Enter the graph space basketballplayer.
nebula [(none)]> use basketballplayer;
Execution succeeded

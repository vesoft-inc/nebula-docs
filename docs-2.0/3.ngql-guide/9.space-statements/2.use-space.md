# USE

```ngql
USE <graph_space_name>
```

The `USE` statement specifies a graph space as the current working space for subsequent queries. To manage multiple graph spaces, use the `USE` statement. The `USE` statement requires some privileges. (TODO: authentication doc)

The graph space remains the same unless another `USE` statement is executed.

```ngql
nebula> USE space1;
-- Traverse in graph space1.
nebula> GO FROM 1 OVER edge1;
nebula> USE space2;
-- Traverse in graph space2. These vertices and edges have no relevance with space1.
nebula> GO FROM 2 OVER edge2;
-- Now you are back to space1. Hereafter, you can not read any data from space2.
nebula> USE space1;
```

> **NOTE**: You can't use two spaces in one statement.

Different from SQL or Fabric Cypher, making a graph space as the working graph space prevents you from accessing other spaces. The only way to traverse in a new graph space is to switch by the `USE` statement.

Graph spaces are `FULLY ISOLATED` from each other. Unlike Fabric Cypher, you can only use one graph space at a time in Nebula Graph. But in Fabric Cypher, you can use two (graph) spaces in one statement.

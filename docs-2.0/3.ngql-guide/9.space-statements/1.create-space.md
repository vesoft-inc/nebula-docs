# CREATE SPACE

Graph spaces are used to store data in a physically isolated way in NebulaGraph, which is similar to the database concept in MySQL. The `CREATE SPACE` statement can create a new graph space or clone the schema of an existing graph space.

## Prerequisites

Only the God role can use the `CREATE SPACE` statement. For more information, see [AUTHENTICATION](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md).

## Syntax

### Create graph spaces

```ngql
CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] <graph_space_name> (
    [partition_num = <partition_number>,]
    [replica_factor = <replica_number>,]
    vid_type = {FIXED_STRING(<N>) | INT[64]}
    )
    [COMMENT = '<comment>']
```

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`IF NOT EXISTS`|Detects if the related graph space exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created. The graph space existence detection here only compares the graph space name (excluding properties).|
|`<graph_space_name>`|1. Uniquely identifies a graph space in a NebulaGraph instance. <br/>2. Space names cannot be modified after they are set.<br/> 3. Space names cannot start with a number; they support 1-4 byte UTF-8 encoded characters, including English letters (case sensitive), numbers, Chinese characters, etc., but do not include special characters other than underscores. To use special characters, reserved keywords or starting with a number, quote them with backticks (\`) and cannot use periods (`.`). For more information, see [Keywords and reserved words](../../3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/keywords-and-reserved-words.md). **Note**: If you name a space in Chinese and encounter a `SyntaxError`, you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (\`).|
|`partition_num`|Specifies the number of partitions in each replica. The suggested value is 20 times (2 times for HDD) the number of the hard disks in the cluster. For example, if you have three hard disks in the cluster, we recommend that you set 60 partitions. The default value is 100.|
|`replica_factor`|Specifies the number of replicas in the cluster. The suggested number is 3 in a production environment and 1 in a test environment. The replica number must be an **odd number** for the need of quorum-based voting. The default value is 1.|
|`vid_type`|A required parameter. Specifies the VID type in a graph space. Available values are `FIXED_STRING(N)` and `INT64`. `INT` equals to `INT64`. <br>``FIXED_STRING(<N>)` specifies the VID as a string, while `INT64` specifies it as an integer. `N` represents the maximum length of the VIDs. If you set a VID that is longer than `N` bytes, NebulaGraph throws an error. Note, for UTF-8 chars, the length may vary in different cases, i.e. a UTF-8 Chinese char is 3 byte, this means 11 Chinese chars(length-33) will exeed a FIXED_STRING(32) vid defination.|
|`COMMENT`|The remarks of the graph space. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there is no comments on a space.|


!!! caution

    - If the replica number is set to one, you will not be able to load balance or scale out the NebulaGraph Storage Service with the [SUBMIT JOB BALANCE](../../8.service-tuning/load-balance.md) statement.
  
    - Restrictions on VID type change and VID length:
  
      - For NebulaGraph v1.x, the type of VIDs can only be `INT64`, and the String type is not allowed. For NebulaGraph v2.x, both `INT64` and `FIXED_STRING(<N>)` VID types are allowed. You must specify the VID type when creating a graph space, and use the same VID type in `INSERT` statements, otherwise, an error message `Wrong vertex id type: 1001` occurs.

      - The length of the VID should not be longer than `N` characters. If it exceeds `N`, NebulaGraph throws `The VID must be a 64-bit integer or a string fitting space vertex id length limit.`.

    - If the `Host not enough!` error appears, the immediate cause is that the number of online storage hosts is less than the value of `replica_factor` specified when creating a graph space. In this case, you can use the `SHOW HOSTS` command to see if the following situations occur:

      - For the case where there is only one storage host in a cluster, the value of `replica_factor` can only be specified to `1`. Or create a graph space after storage hosts are scaled out. 

      - A new storage host is found, but `ADD HOSTS` is not executed to activate it. In this case, run `SHOW HOSTS` to locate the new storage host information and then run `ADD HOSTS` to activate it. A graph space can be created after there are enough storage hosts.

      - For offline storage hosts after running `SHOW HOSTS`, troubleshooting is needed.

!!! compatibility "Legacy version compatibility"

    For NebulaGraph v2.x before v2.5.0, `vid_type` is optional and defaults to `FIXED_STRING(8)`.

!!! note

    `graph_space_name`, `partition_num`, `replica_factor`, `vid_type`, and `comment` cannot be modified once set. To modify them, drop the current working graph space with [`DROP SPACE`](./5.drop-space.md) and create a new one with `CREATE SPACE`.

{{ent.ent_begin}}

When creating a graph space, the system will automatically recognize the value of `--zone_list` in the Meta configuration file, which determines whether the Zone feature is enabled:

  - If the value is empty, it means the Zone feature is not enabled. In this case, the graph space will be created without specifying Zones.
  - If the value is not empty, and the number of Zones in `--zone_list` is equal to the number of replicas specified by `replica_factor`, the replicas of each partition in the graph space will be evenly distributed across the Zones specified in `--zone_list`. If the specified number of replicas is not equal to the number of Zones, the creation of the graph space will fail.

For more details on Zones, see [Manage Zones](../../4.deployment-and-installation/5.zone.md).

### Clone graph spaces

```ngql
CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] <new_graph_space_name> AS <old_graph_space_name>;
```

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
|`IF NOT EXISTS`|Detects if the new graph space exists. If it does not exist, the new one will be created. The graph space existence detection here only compares the graph space name (excluding properties).|
| `<new_graph_space_name>` | The name of the graph space that is newly created. The name of the graph space starts with a letter, supports 1 to 4 bytes UTF-8 encoded characters, such as English letters (case-sensitive), digits, and Chinese characters, but does not support special characters except underscores. For more information, see [Keywords and reserved words](../../3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/keywords-and-reserved-words.md). When a new graph space is created, the schema of the old graph space `<old_graph_space_name>` will be cloned, including its parameters (the number of partitions and replicas, etc.), Tag, Edge type and native indexes. |
| `<old_graph_space_name>` | The name of the graph space that already exists. |

## Examples

```ngql
# The following example creates a graph space with a specified VID type and the maximum length. Other fields still use the default values.
nebula> CREATE SPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_space_1 (vid_type=FIXED_STRING(30));

# The following example creates a graph space with a specified partition number, replica number, and VID type.
nebula> CREATE SPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_space_2 (partition_num=15, replica_factor=1, vid_type=FIXED_STRING(30));

#  The following example creates a graph space with a specified partition number, replica number, and VID type, and adds a comment on it.
nebula> CREATE SPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_space_3 (partition_num=15, replica_factor=1, vid_type=FIXED_STRING(30)) comment="Test the graph space";

# Clone a graph space.
nebula> CREATE SPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_space_4 as my_space_3;
nebula> SHOW CREATE SPACE my_space_4;
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Space        | Create Space                                                                                                                                                 |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "my_space_4" | "CREATE SPACE `my_space_4` (partition_num = 15, replica_factor = 1, charset = utf8, collate = utf8_bin, vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)) comment = '测试图空间'" |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Implementation of the operation

!!! caution

    Trying to use a newly created graph space may fail because the creation is implemented asynchronously. To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds. To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` parameter in the [configuration files](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) for all services. If the heartbeat interval is too short (i.e., less than 5 seconds), disconnection between peers may happen because of the misjudgment of machines in the distributed system.

## Check partition distribution

On some large clusters, the partition distribution is possibly unbalanced because of the different startup times. You can run the following command to do a check of the machine distribution.

```ngql
nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
+-------------+------+----------+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
| Host        | Port | Status   | Leader count | Leader distribution            | Partition distribution         | Version |
+-------------+------+----------+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
| "storaged0" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 8            | "basketballplayer:3, test:5"   | "basketballplayer:10, test:10" | "{{nebula.release}}" |
| "storaged1" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 9            | "basketballplayer:4, test:5"   | "basketballplayer:10, test:10" | "{{nebula.release}}" |
| "storaged2" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 3            | "basketballplayer:3"           | "basketballplayer:10, test:10" | "{{nebula.release}}" |
+-------------+------+----------+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
```

To balance the request loads, use the following command.

```ngql
nebula> BALANCE LEADER;
nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
+-------------+------+----------+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
| Host        | Port | HTTP port | Status   | Leader count | Leader distribution            | Partition distribution         | Version |
+-------------+------+-----------+----------+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
| "storaged0" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 7            | "basketballplayer:3, test:4"   | "basketballplayer:10, test:10" | "{{nebula.release}}" |
| "storaged1" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 7            | "basketballplayer:4, test:3"   | "basketballplayer:10, test:10" | "{{nebula.release}}" |
| "storaged2" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 6            | "basketballplayer:3, test:3"   | "basketballplayer:10, test:10" | "{{nebula.release}}" |
+-------------+------+----------+--------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
```

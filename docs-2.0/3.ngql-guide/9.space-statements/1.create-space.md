# CREATE SPACE

```ngql
CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] <graph_space_name>
    [(partition_num = <partition_number>, 
    replica_factor = <replica_number>, 
    vid_type = {FIXED_STRING(<N>) | INT64})];
```

<!-- `charset` and `collate` now each has only one value. Omit the two options for now.
    charset = <charset>,
    collate = <collate>, 
-->

The `CREATE SPACE` statement creates a new graph space with the given name. A `SPACE` is a region that provides physically isolated graphs in Nebula Graph. An error occurs if a graph space with the same name exists if you did not specify `IF NOT EXISTS`.

## IF NOT EXISTS

You can use the `IF NOT EXISTS` keywords when creating graph spaces. These keywords automatically detect if the related graph space exists. If it does not exist, a new one is created. Otherwise, no graph space is created.

> **NOTE**: The graph space existence detection here only compares the graph space name (excluding properties).

## Graph space name

The `graph_space_name` uniquely identifies a graph space in a Nebula Graph instance.

## Customized graph space options

You can set four optional options for a new graph space:

* `partition_num`

    Specifies the number of partitions in each replica. The suggested number is five times the number of the hard disks in the cluster. For example, if you have 3 hard disks in the cluster, we recommend that you set 15 partitions.

* `replica_factor`

    Specifies the number of replicas in the cluster. The default replica factor is 1. The suggested number is 3 in a production environment and 1 in a test environment. Always set the replica to an odd number for the need of quorum-based voting.

> **NOTICE:** If the replica number is set to one, you won't be able to use the [`BALANCE`](../../8.service-tuning/load-balance.md) statements to load balance or scale out the Nebula Graph Storage Service.

<!--* `charset`

    Short for the character set. A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. The default value is `utf8`.

* `collate`

    A set of rules for comparing characters in a character set. The default value is `utf8_bin`.
-->

* `vid_type`

    Specifies the data type of VIDs in a graph space. Available values are `FIXED_STRING(N)` and `INT64`, where `N` represents the maximum length of the VIDs and it must be a positive integer. The default value is `FIXED_STRING(8)`. 
    
    If you set a VID length greater than `N`, Nebula Graph throws an error. To set the integer VID for vertices, set `vid_type` to `INT64`.

If no option is given, Nebula Graph creates the graph space with the default options.

## Example

```ngql
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_1; -- create a graph space with default options
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_2(partition_num=10); -- create a graph space with customized partition number
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_3(replica_factor=1); -- create a graph space with customized replica factor
nebula> CREATE SPACE my_space_4(vid_type = FIXED_STRING(30)); -- create a graph space with customized VID maximum length
```

## Implementation of the operation

Trying to use a newly created graph space may fail because the creation is implemented asynchronously.

Nebula Graph implements the creation in the next heartbeat cycle. To make sure the creation is successful, take one of the following approaches:

* Find the new graph space in the result of [`SHOW SPACES`](3.show-spaces.md) or [`DESCRIBE SPACE`](4.describe-space.md). If you can't, wait a few seconds and try again.
* Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds.

To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` parameter in the [configuration files](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) for all services.

## Check partition distribution

On some large clusters, the partition distribution is possibly unbalanced because of the different startup times. You can run the command to do a check of the machine distribution.

```ngql
nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Host      | Port  | Status | Leader count | Leader distribution              | Partition distribution      |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| storaged0 | 9779  | ONLINE | 1            | basketballplayer:5               | basketballplayer:5          |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| storaged1 | 9779  | ONLINE | 2            | test:1, basketballplayer:5       | basketballplayer:5, test:1  |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| storaged2 | 9779  | ONLINE | 1            | basketballplayer:5               | basketballplayer:5          |
+-----------+-------+--------+--------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------+
```

To balance the request loads, use the following command.

```ngql
nebula> BALANCE LEADER;
```

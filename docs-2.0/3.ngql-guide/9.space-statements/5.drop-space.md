# DROP SPACE

`DROP SPACE` deletes the specified graph space and everything in it.

## Prerequisites

Only the God role can use the `DROP SPACE` statement. For more information, see [AUTHENTICATION](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md).

## Syntax

```ngql
DROP SPACE [IF EXISTS] <graph_space_name>;
```

You can use the `IF EXISTS` keywords when dropping spaces. These keywords automatically detect if the related graph space exists. If it exists, it will be deleted. Otherwise, no graph space will be deleted.

!!! compatibility "Legacy version compatibility"

    In Nebula Graph versions earlier than 3.1.0, the `DROP SPACE` statement does not remove all the files and directories from the disk.

        **BE CAUTIOUS** about running the `DROP SPACE` statement.

# DROP SPACE

The `DROP SPACE` statement deletes everything in the specified graph space.

!!! danger

    Before dropping a graph space, make sure that you have backed up all the important data stored in it. Otherwise, once the graph space is dropped, the data cannot be restored.

```ngql
DROP SPACE [IF EXISTS] <graph_space_name>
```

You must have the `DROP` [privilege](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md) for the related graph space.

You can use the `IF EXISTS` keywords when dropping spaces. These keywords automatically detects if the related graph space exists. If it exists, it is deleted. Otherwise, no graph space is deleted.

Other graph spaces stay unchanged.

The `DROP SPACE` statement does not immediately remove all the files and directories from disk. `Use` another `space`, and `submit job compact`.

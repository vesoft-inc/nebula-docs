# DROP SPACE

`DROP SPACE` deletes the specified graph space and everything in it.

## Prerequisites

Only the God role can use the `DROP SPACE` statement. For more information, see [AUTHENTICATION](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md).

## Syntax

```ngql
DROP SPACE [IF EXISTS] <graph_space_name>;
```

You can use the `IF EXISTS` keywords when dropping spaces. These keywords automatically detect if the related graph space exists. If it exists, it will be deleted. Otherwise, no graph space will be deleted.

The `DROP SPACE` statement does not remove all the files and directories from the disk. To remove all the files and directories, add `auto_remove_invalid_space=true` to the Storage Service configuration file. For the file path, see [Storage Service configurations](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md).

!!! caution

        **BE CAUTIOUS** about running the `DROP SPACE` statement.

# Keywords

Keywords have significance in nGQL. It can be classified into reserved keywords and non-reserved keywords.

Non-reserved keywords are permitted as identifiers without quoting. To use reserved keywords as identifiers, quote them with backticks such as `AND`.

!!! Note

    Keywords are case-insensitive.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG TAG(name string);
[ERROR (-7)]: SyntaxError: syntax error near `TAG'

nebula> CREATE TAG `TAG` (name string);
Execution succeeded

nebula> CREATE TAG SPACE(name string);
Execution succeeded
```

- `TAG` is a reserved keyword. To use `TAG` as an identifier, you must quote it with backticks.

- `SPACE` is a non-reserved keyword. You can use it as an identifier without quoting it.

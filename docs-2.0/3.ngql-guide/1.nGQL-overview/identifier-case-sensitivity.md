# Identifier case sensitivity

## Identifiers are Case-Sensitive

The following statements will not work because they refer to two different spaces, i.e. `my_space` and `MY_SPACE`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE SPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_space (vid_type=FIXED_STRING(30));
nebula> use MY_SPACE;
[ERROR (-1005)]: SpaceNotFound:
```

## Keywords and Reserved Words are Case-Insensitive

The following statements are equivalent since `show` and `spaces` are keywords.

```ngql
nebula> show spaces;  
nebula> SHOW SPACES;
nebula> SHOW spaces;
nebula> show SPACES;
```

## Functions are Case-Insensitive

Functions are case-insensitive. For example, `count()`, `COUNT()`, and `couNT()` are equivalent.

```ngql
nebula> WITH [NULL, 1, 1, 2, 2] As a \
        UNWIND a AS b \
        RETURN count(b), COUNT(*), couNT(DISTINCT b);
+----------+----------+-------------------+
| count(b) | COUNT(*) | couNT(distinct b) |
+----------+----------+-------------------+
| 4        | 5        | 2                 |
+----------+----------+-------------------+
```

# Keywords and Reserved Words

Keywords have significance in nGQL. Certain keywords are reserved and require special treatment for use as identifiers.

Non-reserved keywords are permitted as identifiers without quoting. Non-reserved keywords are case-insensitive. To use reserved keywords as identifiers, quote them with back quotes such as \`AND\`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG TAG(name string);
[ERROR (-7)]: SyntaxError: syntax error near `TAG'

// SPACE is an unreserved keyword.
nebula> CREATE TAG SPACE(name string);
Execution succeeded
```

`TAG` is a reserved keyword. To use `TAG` as an identifier, you must quote it with a backtick. `SPACE` is a non-reserved keyword. You can use `SPACE` as an identifier without quoting it.

```ngql
// TAG is a reserved keyword here.
nebula> CREATE TAG `TAG` (name string);
Execution succeeded
```

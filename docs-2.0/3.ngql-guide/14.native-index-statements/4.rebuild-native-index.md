# REBUILD INDEX

```ngql
REBUILD {TAG | EDGE} INDEX <index_name>
```

Use `REBUILD INDEX` to rebuild the created tag or edge type index. For details on how to create index, see [CREATE INDEX](1.create-native-index.md).

If the index is created before data insertion, there is no need to rebuild the index. If data is updated or newly inserted before the index creation, you need to rebuild the indexes in order to make sure that the indexes contain the previously added data.

> **NOTE:** During the rebuilding, all queries skip the index and perform sequential scans. This means that the return results can be different because the not all the data is indexed during rebuilding.

After rebuilding is complete, you can use the `SHOW {TAG | EDGE} INDEX STATUS` command to check if the index is successfully rebuilt. For details on index status, see [SHOW INDEX STATUS](5.show-native-index-status.md).

## Example

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG person(name string, age int, gender string, email string);
Execution succeeded (Time spent: 10.051/11.397 ms)

nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX single_person_index ON person(name(10));
Execution succeeded (Time spent: 2.168/3.379 ms)

nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX single_person_index;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 66         |
+------------+

nebula> SHOW TAG INDEX STATUS;
```

Nebula Graph creates a job to rebuild the index. The job ID is displayed in the preceding return message. To check if the rebuilding process is complete, use the `SHOW JOB <job_id>` statement. For more information, see [SHOW JOB](../18.operation-and-maintenance-statements/4.job-statements.md/#show-job-job_id).

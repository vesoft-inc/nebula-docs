# DROP INDEX

```ngql
DROP {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF EXISTS] <index_name>
```

The `DROP INDEX` statement removes an existing index from the current graph space. Removing a nonexistent index results in an error. You can use the `IF EXISTS` option to conditionally drop the index and avoid the error. To run this statement you need some privilege. For information about the built-in roles in NebulaÂ Graph, see [Built-in roles](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

## Example

```ngql
nebula> DROP TAG INDEX player_index_0;
```

This query drops a tag index names `player_index_0`.

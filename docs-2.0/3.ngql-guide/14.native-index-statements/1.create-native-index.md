# CREATE INDEX

Use `CREATE INDEX` to add native indexes for existing tags, edge types or properties.

!!! note

    For how to create text-based indexes, see [Deploy full-text index](../../4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/2.deploy-es.md).

Most graph queries start the traversal from a list of vertices or edges that are identified by their properties. Indexes make these global retrieval operations efficient on large graphs.

## Prerequisites

Before you create an index, make sure that the relative tag or edge type is created. For how to create tags or edge types, see [CREATE TAG](../10.tag-statements/1.create-tag.md) and [CREATE EDGE](../11.edge-type-statements/1.create-edge.md).

## Must-read for using index

Correct use of indexes can speed up queries, but indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance reduction can be as much as 90% or even more. **DO NOT** use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service.

If you must use indexes, we suggest that you:

1. Import data into Nebula Graph.
2. Create indexes.
3. Rebuild the indexes.

The preceding workflow minimizes the negative influences of using indexes.

## Syntax

```ngql
CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name> ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} ([prop_name_list])
```

- `index_name`: The name of the index. It must be unique in a graph space. A recommended way of naming is `i_tagName_propName`.

- `IF NOT EXISTS`: Creating an existent index results in an error. You can use the `IF NOT EXISTS` option to conditionally create the index and avoid the error.

- `prop_name_list`:

  - To index a **variable** string property, you must use the `prop_name(length)` syntax to specify an index length.

    !!! note

        Long indexes decrease the scan performance of the Storage Service and use more memory. We suggest that you set the indexing length the same as that of the longest string to be indexed. The longest indexing length is 255. Strings longer than 255 are truncated.

  - To index a **fixed-length** string property, you must use the `prop_name` syntax, and the index length is the string length you set.

  - To index a tag or an edge type, ignore the `prop_name_list` in the parentheses.

    !!! note

        When there is an index for any property of a tag or an edge type, creating another index for the tag or edge type is neither supported nor necessary.

## Implementation of the operation

Nebula Graph implements the creation of the index asynchronously in the next heartbeat cycle. To make sure the creation is successful, take one of the following approaches:

- Find the new index in the result of [`SHOW TAG/EDGE INDEXES`](2.show-native-indexes.md).
- Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds.

To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` parameter in the [configuration files] for all services.

## Create tag/edge type indexes

The following statement creates an index on the `player` tag.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX player_index on player();
```

The following statement creates indexes on the edge type `like`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX like_index on like();
```

After indexing a tag or an edge type, you can use the `LOOKUP` statement to retrieve the VID of all vertices with the tag, or the source vertex ID, destination vertex ID, and ranks of all edges with the edge type. For more information, see [List vertices or edges with a tag or an edge type](../7.general-query-statements/5.lookup.md).

## Create single-property indexes

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX player_index_0 on player(name(10));
```

The preceding statement creates an index for the `name` property on all vertices carrying the `player` tag. This statement creates an index using the first 10 characters of the name property.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG var_string(p1 string);
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX var ON var_string(p1(10));

nebula> CREATE TAG fix_string(p1 FIXED_STRING(10));
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX fix ON fix_string(p1);
```

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX follow_index_0 on follow(degree);
```

The preceding statement creates an index for the `degree` property on all edges carrying the `follow` edge type.

## Create composite property indexes

An index on multiple properties is called a composite index.

!!! note

    Creating index across multiple tags is not supported.

Consider the following example:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX player_index_1 on player(name(10), age);
```

This statement creates a composite index for the `name` and `age` property on all vertices carrying the `player` tag.

Nebula Graph follows the left matching principle to select indexes. That is, columns in the `WHERE` conditions must be in the first N columns of the index. For example:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX example_index ON TAG t(p1, p2, p3);  -- Create an index for the first 3 properties of tag t
nebula> LOOKUP ON t WHERE p2 == 1 and p3 == 1; -- Not supported
nebula> LOOKUP ON t WHERE p1 == 1;  -- Supported
nebula> LOOKUP ON t WHERE p1 == 1 and p2 == 1;  -- Supported
nebula> LOOKUP ON t WHERE p1 == 1 and p2 == 1 and p3 == 1;  -- Supported
```

## Using index

After the index is created and data is inserted, you can use [LOOKUP](../7.general-query-statements/5.lookup.md) or [MATCH](../7.general-query-statements/2.match.md) to query the data.

You do not need to specify which indexes to use in a query, Nebula Graph figures that out by itself.

# CREATE INDEX

## Prerequisites

Before you create an index, make sure that the relative tag or edge type is created. For how to create tags or edge types, see [CREATE TAG](../10.tag-statements/1.create-tag.md) and [CREATE EDGE](../11.edge-type-statements/1.create-edge.md).

For how to create full-text indexes, see [Deploy full-text index](../../4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/2.deploy-es.md).

## Must-read for using indexes

The concept and using restrictions of indexes are comparatively complex. Before you use indexes, you must read the following sections carefully.

You can use `CREATE INDEX` to add native indexes for the existing tags, edge types, or properties. They are usually called as tag indexes, edge type indexes, and property indexes.

- Tag indexes and edge type indexes apply to queries related to the tag and the edge type, but do not apply to queries that are based on certain properties on the tag. For example, you can use `LOOKUP` to retrieve all the vertices with the tag `player`.

- Property indexes apply to property-based queries. For example, you can use the `age` property to retrieve the VID of all vertices that meet `age == 19`.

If a property index `i_TA` is created for the property `A` of the tag `T` and `i_T` for the tag `T`, the indexes can be replaced as follows (the same for edge type indexes):

- The query engine can use `i_TA` to replace `i_T`.

- In the `MATCH` and `LOOKUP` statements, `i_T` may replace `i_TA` for querying properties.

  !!! compatibility "Legacy version compatibility"

        In previous releases, the tag or edge type index in the `LOOKUP` statement cannot replace the property index for property queries.

Although the same results can be obtained by using alternative indexes for queries, the query performance varies according to the selected index.

!!! caution

    Indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance. The performance can be greatly reduced<!-- as much as 90% or even more-->. **DO NOT** use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service.

    Long indexes decrease the scan performance of the Storage Service and use more memory. We suggest that you set the indexing length the same as that of the longest string to be indexed. For variable-length string-type properties, the longest index length is 256 bytes; for fixed-length string-type properties, the longest index length is the length of the index itself.
## Steps

If you must use indexes, we suggest that you:

1. Import the data into NebulaGraph.

2. Create indexes.

3. [Rebuild indexes](4.rebuild-native-index.md).

4. After the index is created and the data is imported, you can use [LOOKUP](../7.general-query-statements/5.lookup.md) or [MATCH](../7.general-query-statements/2.match.md) to retrieve the data. You do not need to specify which indexes to use in a query, NebulaGraph figures that out by itself.

!!! Note

    If you create an index before importing the data, the importing speed will be extremely slow due to the reduction in the write performance.

    Keep `--disable_auto_compaction = false` during daily incremental writing.

    The newly created index will not take effect immediately. Trying to use a newly created index (such as `LOOKUP` or`REBUILD INDEX`) may fail and return `can't find xxx in the space` because the creation is implemented asynchronously. To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds. To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` in the [configuration files](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) for all services.

!!! danger

    After creating a new index, or dropping the old index and creating a new one with the same name again, you must `REBUILD INDEX`. Otherwise, these data cannot be returned in the `MATCH` and `LOOKUP` statements.

## Syntax

```ngql
CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name> ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} ([<prop_name_list>]) [COMMENT '<comment>'];
```

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`TAG | EDGE`|Specifies the index type that you want to create.|
|`IF NOT EXISTS`|Detects if the index that you want to create exists. If it does not exist, a new one will be created.|
|`<index_name>`|The name of the index. It must be unique in a graph space. A recommended way of naming is `i_tagName_propName`. <br/>Index names cannot start with a number. They supports 1 to 4 bytes UTF-8 encoded characters, such as English letters (case-sensitive), numbers, and Chinese characters, but does not support special characters except underscores. To use special characters, reserved keywords, or starting with a number, quote them with backticks. For more information, see [Keywords and reserved words](../../3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/keywords-and-reserved-words.md).<br/>**Note**: If you name an index in Chinese and encounter a `SyntaxError`, you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (\`). |
|`<tag_name> | <edge_name>`|Specifies the name of the tag or edge associated with the index.|
|`<prop_name_list>`|To index a **variable-length** string property, you must use `prop_name(length)` to specify the index length, and the maximum index length is 256. To index a tag or an edge type, ignore the `prop_name_list`.|
|`COMMENT`|The remarks of the index. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on an index.|

## Create tag/edge type indexes

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS player_index on player();
```

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS follow_index on follow();
```

After indexing a tag or an edge type, you can use the `LOOKUP` statement to retrieve the VID of all vertices `with the tag`, or `the source vertex ID, destination vertex ID, and ranks` of `all edges with the edge type`. For more information, see [LOOKUP](../7.general-query-statements/5.lookup.md).

## Create single-property indexes

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS player_index_0 on player(name(10));
```

The preceding example creates an index for the `name` property on all vertices carrying the `player` tag. This example creates an index using the first 10 characters of the `name` property.

```ngql
# To index a variable-length string property, you need to specify the index length.
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS var_string(p1 string);
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS var ON var_string(p1(10));

# To index a fixed-length string property, you do not need to specify the index length.
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS fix_string(p1 FIXED_STRING(10));
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS fix ON fix_string(p1);
```

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS follow_index_0 on follow(degree);
```

## Create composite property indexes

An index on multiple properties on a tag (or an edge type) is called a composite property index.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS player_index_1 on player(name(10), age);
```

!!! caution

    Creating composite property indexes across multiple tags or edge types is not supported.

!!! note

    NebulaGraph follows the left matching principle to select indexes.
<!--    
    Note that:
    
    - If the `LOOKUP` statement does not match the composite property index, it will degenerate into a full table scan.
    
    - If the `MATCH` statement does not match the composite property index, an error will be returned.
    
    See the following examples.

    ```ngql
    # Create a composite property index for the first three properties of the tag t.
    nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX example_index ON TAG t(p1, p2, p3);

    # Note: The index cannot be matched, because it does not start from p1. An error that a valid index cannot be found will be returned.
    nebula> MATCH (v:t) WHERE t.p2 == 2 and t.p3 == 3; 
    
    # Note: The index cannot be matched and it will degenerate into a full table scan for querying.
    nebula> LOOKUP ON t2 where t.p2 == 2;

    # The index can be matched.
    nebula> MATCH (v:t) WHERE t.p1 == 1;  
    # The index can be matched because p1 and p2 are consecutive.
    nebula> MATCH (v:t) WHERE t.p1 == 1 and t.p2 == 2;  
    # The index can be matched because p1, p2, and p3 are consecutive.
    nebula> MATCH (v:t) WHERE t.p1 == 1 and t.p2 == 2 and t.p3 == 3; 
    ```

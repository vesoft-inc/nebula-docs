# YIELD

`YIELD` defines the output of an nGQL query.

`YIELD` can lead a clause or a statement:

* A `YIELD` clause works in nGQL statements such as `GO`, `FETCH`, or `LOOKUP` and must be defined to return the result.

* A `YIELD` statement works in a composite query or independently.

## OpenCypher compatibility

This topic applies to native nGQL only. For the openCypher syntax, use [`RETURN`](return.md).

`YIELD` has different functions in openCypher and nGQL.

* In openCypher, `YIELD` is used in the `CALL[…YIELD]` clause to specify the output of the procedure call.

  !!! note

        NGQL does not support `CALL[…YIELD]` yet.

* In nGQL, `YIELD` works like `RETURN` in openCypher.

!!! note
    In the following examples, `$$` and `$-` are reference operators. For more information, see [Operators](../5.operators/5.property-reference.md).

## YIELD clauses

### Syntax

```ngql
YIELD [DISTINCT] <col> [AS <alias>] [, <col> [AS <alias>] ...];
```

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                   |
| :---       | :---                                                                                          |
| `DISTINCT` | Aggregates the output and makes the statement return a distinct result set.                   |
| `col`      | A field to be returned. If no alias is set, `col` will be a column name in the output.        |
| `alias`    | An alias for `col`. It is set after the keyword `AS` and will be a column name in the output. |

### Use a YIELD clause in a statement

* Use `YIELD` with `GO`:

    ```ngql
    nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
            YIELD properties($$).name AS Friend, properties($$).age AS Age;
    +-----------------+-----+
    | Friend          | Age |
    +-----------------+-----+
    | "Tony Parker"   | 36  |
    | "Manu Ginobili" | 41  |
    +-----------------+-----+
    ```

* Use `YIELD` with `FETCH`:

    ```ngql
    nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player100" \
            YIELD properties(vertex).name;
    +-------------------------+
    | properties(VERTEX).name |
    +-------------------------+
    | "Tim Duncan"            |
    +-------------------------+
    ```

* Use `YIELD` with `LOOKUP`:

    ```ngql
    nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == "Tony Parker" \
            YIELD properties(vertex).name, properties(vertex).age;
    +-------------------------+------------------------+
    | properties(VERTEX).name | properties(VERTEX).age |
    +-------------------------+------------------------+
    | "Tony Parker"           | 36                     |
    +-------------------------+------------------------+
    ```

## YIELD statements

### Syntax

```ngql
YIELD [DISTINCT] <col> [AS <alias>] [, <col> [AS <alias>] ...]
[WHERE <conditions>];
```

| Parameter    | Description                                                                                             |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DISTINCT`   | Aggregates the output and makes the statement return a distinct result set.                             |
| `col`        | A field to be returned. If no alias is set, `col` will be a column name in the output.                  |
| `alias`      | An alias for `col`. It is set after the keyword `AS` and will be a column name in the output.           |
| `conditions` | Conditions set in a `WHERE` clause to filter the output. For more information, see [`WHERE`](where.md). |

### Use a YIELD statement in a composite query

In a [composite query](../4.variable-and-composite-queries/1.composite-queries.md), a `YIELD` statement accepts, filters, and modifies the result set of the preceding statement, and then outputs it.

The following query finds the players that "player100" follows and calculates their average age.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
        YIELD dst(edge) AS ID \
        | FETCH PROP ON player $-.ID \
        YIELD properties(vertex).age AS Age \
        | YIELD AVG($-.Age) as Avg_age, count(*)as Num_friends;
+---------+-------------+
| Avg_age | Num_friends |
+---------+-------------+
| 38.5    | 2           |
+---------+-------------+
```

The following query finds the players that "player101" follows with the follow degrees greater than 90.

```ngql
nebula> $var1 = GO FROM "player101" OVER follow \
        YIELD properties(edge).degree AS Degree, dst(edge) as ID; \
        YIELD $var1.ID AS ID WHERE $var1.Degree > 90;
+-------------+
| ID          |
+-------------+
| "player100" |
| "player125" |
+-------------+
```

The following query finds the vertices in the player that are older than 30 and younger than 32, and returns the de-duplicate results.

```ngql
nebula> LOOKUP ON player  \
        WHERE player.age < 32 and player.age >30  \
        YIELD DISTINCT properties(vertex).age as v;
+--------+
| v      |
+--------+
| 31     |
+--------+
```

### Use a standalone YIELD statement

A `YIELD` statement can calculate a valid expression and output the result.

```ngql
nebula> YIELD rand32(1, 6);
+-------------+
| rand32(1,6) |
+-------------+
| 3           |
+-------------+

nebula> YIELD "Hel" + "\tlo" AS string1, ", World!" AS string2;
+-------------+------------+
| string1     | string2    |
+-------------+------------+
| "Hel    lo" | ", World!" |
+-------------+------------+

nebula> YIELD hash("Tim") % 100;
+-----------------+
| (hash(Tim)%100) |
+-----------------+
| 42              |
+-----------------+

nebula> YIELD \
      CASE 2+3 \
      WHEN 4 THEN 0 \
      WHEN 5 THEN 1 \
      ELSE -1 \
      END \
      AS result;
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 1      |
+--------+

nebula> YIELD 1- -1;
+----------+
| (1--(1)) |
+----------+
| 2        |
+----------+
```

# User-defined variables

User-defined variables allows passing the result of one statement to another. User-defined variables are written as `$var_name`. The `var_name` consists of alphanumeric characters. Any other characters are not permitted.

## OpenCypher variables

In openCypher, when you refer to a variable of vertex, edge or path, you need to name it first. The name you give to the pattern is a variable. For example:

```ngql
nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:"Tim Duncan"}) RETURN v;
+----------------------------------------------------+
| v                                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| ("player100" :player{name: "Tim Duncan", age: 42}) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
```

The user-defined variable in the preceding query is `v`.

## nGQL extensions

User-defined variables can only be used in one execution. For example, you can use user-defined variables in composite queries separated by semicolon `;` or pipe `|`. Details about composite queries, see [Composite queries](1.composite-queries.md).

> **NOTE**: A user-defined variable is valid only at the current session and execution.

A user-defined variable in one statement **CANNOT** be used in either other clients or other executions. The statement that defines the user-defined variable and the statement that uses it must be submitted together. When this session ends, the user-defined variable is automatically expired.

> **NOTE**: User-defined variables are case-sensitive.

## Example

```ngql
nebula> $var = GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD follow._dst AS id; \
GO FROM $var.id OVER serve YIELD $$.team.name AS Team, \
$^.player.name AS Player;
+---------+-------------+
| Team    | Player      |
+---------+-------------+
| Nuggets | Tony Parker |
+---------+-------------+
```

# Property reference

> This page applies to nGQL extensions only.

You can refer to the properties of a vertex or an edge in `WHERE` or `YIELD` syntax.

## Property reference for vertex

### For source vertex

```ngql
$^.tag_name.prop_name
```

`$^` is used to get the property of the source vertex, `tag_name` is the `tag` of the vertex, and `prop_name` specifies the property name.

### For destination vertex

```ngql
$$.tag_name.prop_name
```

`$$` is used to get the property of the destination vertex, `tag_name` is the `tag` of the vertex, and `prop_name` specifies the property name.

## Property reference for edge

### For property

Use the following syntax to get the property of an edge.

```ngql
edge_type.prop_name
```

`edge_type` is the edge type of the edge, and `prop_name` specifies the property name.

### For built-in properties

There are four built-in properties in each edge:

* `_src`: source vertex ID of the edge
* `_dst`: destination vertex ID of the edge
* `_type`: edge type
* `_rank`: the rank value for the edge

You can use `_src` and `_dst` to get the starting and ending vertices' ID, and they are very commonly used to show a graph path.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD $^.player.name AS startName, $$.player.age AS endAge;
+--------------+--------+
| startName    | endAge |
+--------------+--------+
| "Tim Duncan" | 36     |
+--------------+--------+
| "Tim Duncan" | 33     |
+--------------+--------+
```

The preceding query returns the `name` property of the source vertex and the `age` property of the destination vertex.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD follow.degree;
+---------------+
| follow.degree |
+---------------+
| 95            |
+---------------+
| 90            |
+---------------+
```

The preceding query returns the `degree` property of the edge.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow YIELD follow._src, follow._dst, follow._type, follow._rank;
+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| follow._src | follow._dst | follow._type | follow._rank |
+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| "player100" | "player101" | 136          | 0            |
+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| "player100" | "player102" | 136          | 0            |
+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
```

The preceding query returns all the neighbors of vertex `"player100"` over the `follow` edges,
by referencing `follow._src` as the source vertex ID (which is `"player100"`) and `follow._dst` as the destination vertex ID.

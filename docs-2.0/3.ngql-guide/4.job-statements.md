# Job manager and the JOB statements

The long-term tasks run by the Storage Service are called jobs, such as `COMPACT`, `FLUSH`, and `STATS`. These jobs can be time-consuming if the data amount in the graph space is large. The job manager helps you run, show, stop, and recover jobs.

!!! note

    All job management commands can be executed only after selecting a graph space.

{{ ent.ent_begin }}

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA

!!! enterpriseonly

    Only available for the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.

!!! caution

    - Before performing the job, it is recommended to [create a snapshot](../backup-and-restore/3.manage-snapshot.md).
    - During job execution, do not execute other jobs, such as `SUBMIT JOB STATS`, `REBUILD INDEX`, etc.
    - During job execution, it is recommended not to write or read data in large batches.

The `SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA` statement starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in the current graph space. It returns the job ID.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 28         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA REMOVE

!!! enterpriseonly

    Only available for the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.

Starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in the current graph space. The default port is `9779`. It returns the job ID.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA REMOVE 192.168.8.100:9779;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 29         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE 

!!! enterpriseonly

    Only available for the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.

`SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE` statement starts a job to balance partition replicas within each Zone. It returns the job ID. 

<!-- To balance partition replicas within a specified Zone, you need to add the `<zone_name>` option.  -->

For details on zones, see [Manage Zones](../4.deployment-and-installation/5.zone.md).

For example:

```ngql
# Balance partition replicas within each Zone in the current space.
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 25         |
+------------+
```

<!-- ```ngql
# Balance partition replicas within a specified Zone.
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE az1;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 26         |
+------------+
``` -->

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE REMOVE

!!! enterpriseonly

    Only available for the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.

`SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE REMOVE` statement starts a job to clear the partitions on specified Storage nodes in Zones in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. Before clearing the Storage nodes, make sure that the remaining Storage nodes in Zones can meet the set number of replicas. For example, if the number of replicas is set to 3, make sure that the remaining Storage nodes are greater than or equal to 3 before executing this command.

For details on Zones, see [Manage Zones](../4.deployment-and-installation/5.zone.md).

For example:

```ngql
# Clear the partitions on the specified Storage nodes. 
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE REMOVE 192.168.10.101:9779,192.168.10.102:9779;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 26         |
+------------+
```

{{ ent.ent_end }}

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE LEADER

Starts a job to balance the distribution of all the storage leaders in all graph spaces. It returns the job ID.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE LEADER;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 33         |
+------------+
```

<!-- balance-3.1
## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE

The `SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE` statement starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in each zone in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. You can use the `REMOVE` option to specify the Storage services that you want to clear for easy maintenance.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE DATA IN ZONE REMOVE 192.168.10.102:9779;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 26         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB BALANCE ACROSS ZONE

The `SUBMIT JOB BALANCE ACROSS ZONE` statement starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions across all the zones in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. You can use the `REMOVE` option to specify the zones that you want to clear for easy maintenance.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB BALANCE ACROSS ZONE REMOVE "zone1";
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 27         |
+------------+
```
-->

## SUBMIT JOB COMPACT

The `SUBMIT JOB COMPACT` statement triggers the long-term RocksDB `compact` operation in the current graph space.

For more information about `compact` configuration, see [Storage Service configuration](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md).

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB COMPACT;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 40         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB FLUSH

The `SUBMIT JOB FLUSH` statement writes the RocksDB memfile in the memory to the hard disk in the current graph space.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB FLUSH;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 96         |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB STATS

The `SUBMIT JOB STATS` statement starts a job that makes the statistics of the current graph space. Once this job succeeds, you can use the `SHOW STATS` statement to list the statistics. For more information, see [SHOW STATS](7.general-query-statements/6.show/14.show-stats.md).

!!! note

    If the data stored in the graph space changes, in order to get the latest statistics, you have to run `SUBMIT JOB STATS` again.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB STATS;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 9          |
+------------+
```

## SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD/INGEST

The `SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS` and `SUBMIT JOB INGEST` commands are used to import the SST file into NebulaGraph. For detail, see [Import data from SST files](../nebula-exchange/use-exchange/ex-ug-import-from-sst.md).

The `SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS` command will download the SST file on the specified HDFS.

The `SUBMIT JOB INGEST` command will import the downloaded SST file into NebulaGraph.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SUBMIT JOB DOWNLOAD HDFS "hdfs://192.168.10.100:9000/sst";
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 10         |
+------------+
nebula> SUBMIT JOB INGEST;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 11         |
+------------+
```

## SHOW JOB

The Meta Service parses a `SUBMIT JOB` request into multiple tasks and assigns them to the nebula-storaged processes. The `SHOW JOB <job_id>` statement shows the information about a specific job and all its tasks in the current graph space.

`job_id` is returned when you run the `SUBMIT JOB` statement.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW JOB 8;
+----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+
| Job Id(TaskId) | Command(Dest)   | Status     | Start Time                 | Stop Time                  | Error Code  |
+----------------+-----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+
| 8              | "STATS"         | "FINISHED" | 2022-10-18T08:14:45.000000 | 2022-10-18T08:14:45.000000 | "SUCCEEDED" |
| 0              | "192.168.8.129" | "FINISHED" | 2022-10-18T08:14:45.000000 | 2022-10-18T08:15:13.000000 | "SUCCEEDED" |
| "Total:1"      | "Succeeded:1"   | "Failed:0" | "In Progress:0"            | ""                         | ""          |

       \          \            /
        \ ---------- stopped -/
```

## SHOW JOBS

The `SHOW JOBS` statement lists all the unexpired jobs in the current graph space.

The default job expiration interval is one week. You can change it by modifying the `job_expired_secs` parameter of the Meta Service. For how to modify `job_expired_secs`, see [Meta Service configuration](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md).

For example:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW JOBS;
+--------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| Job Id | Command             | Status     | Start Time                 | Stop Time                  |
+--------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| 34     | "STATS"             | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:27.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:27.000000 |
| 33     | "FLUSH"             | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:15.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:15.000000 |
| 32     | "COMPACT"           | "FINISHED" | 2021-11-01T03:32:06.000000 | 2021-11-01T03:32:06.000000 |

| 10     | "COMPACT"           | "FINISHED" | 2021-10-26T02:27:05.000000 | 2021-10-26T02:27:05.000000 |
+--------+---------------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
```

## STOP JOB

The `STOP JOB <job_id>` statement stops jobs that are not finished in the current graph space.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> STOP JOB 22;
+---------------+
| Result        |
+---------------+
| "Job stopped" |
+---------------+
```

## RECOVER JOB

The `RECOVER JOB [<job_id>]` statement re-executes the jobs that status is `FAILED` or `STOPPED` in the current graph space and returns the number of recovered jobs. If `<job_id>` is not specified, re-execution is performed from the earliest job and the number of jobs that have been recovered is returned.

For example:

```ngql
nebula> RECOVER JOB;
+-------------------+
| Recovered job num |
+-------------------+
| 5 job recovered   |
+-------------------+
```

## FAQ

### How to troubleshoot job problems?

The `SUBMIT JOB` operations use the HTTP port. Please check if the HTTP ports on the machines where the Storage Service is running are working well. You can use the following command to debug.

```bash
curl "http://{storaged-ip}:19779/admin?space={space_name}&op=compact"
```

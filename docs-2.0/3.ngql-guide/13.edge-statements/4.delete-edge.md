# DELETE EDGE

The `DELETE EDGE` statement deletes one edge or multiple edges at a time. You can use `DELETE EDGE` together with pipe operators. For more information, see [PIPE OPERATORS](../5.operators/4.pipe.md).

To delete all the outgoing edges for a vertex, please delete the vertex. For more information, see [DELETE VERTEX](../12.vertex-statements/4.delete-vertex.md).

## Syntax

```ngql
DELETE EDGE <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] ...]
```

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> DELETE EDGE serve "player100" -> "team204"@0;
```

The following example shows that you can use `DELETE EDGE` together with pipe operators to delete edges that meet the conditions.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
        WHERE dst(edge) == "team204" \
        YIELD src(edge) AS src, dst(edge) AS dst, rank(edge) AS rank \
        | DELETE EDGE follow $-.src->$-.dst @ $-.rank;
```

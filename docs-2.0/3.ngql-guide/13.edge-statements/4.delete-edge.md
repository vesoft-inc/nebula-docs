# DELETE EDGE

```ngql
DELETE EDGE <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] [, <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] ...]
```

Use `DELETE EDGE` to delete edges. The `DELETE EDGE` statement deletes one edge or multiple edges at a time. You can use `DELETE EDGE` together with pipe. For more information about pipe, see [Pipe operator](../5.operators/4.pipe.md).

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> DELETE EDGE serve "player100" -> "team200"@0;
```

This query deletes the `serve` edge from `"player100"` to `"team200"`, of which the rank value is 0.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow WHERE follow._dst == "team200" YIELD follow._src AS src, follow._dst AS dst, follow._rank AS rank | \
DELETE EDGE follow $-.src->$-.dst @ $-.rank;
```

This query shows that you can use `DELETE EDGE` together with pipe. This query first traverses all the `follow` edges with different rank values from `"player100"` to `"team200"` then deletes them.

To delete all the outgoing edges for a vertex, delete the vertex. For more information, see [DELETE VERTEX](../12.vertex-statements/4.delete-vertex.md).

!!! note

    Atomic operation is not guaranteed during the entire process for now, so please retry when a failure occurs.

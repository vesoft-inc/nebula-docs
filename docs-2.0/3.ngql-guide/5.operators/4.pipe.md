# Pipe operator

## OpenCypher compatibility

This page applies to nGQL extensions only.

## Syntax

One major difference between nGQL and SQL is how sub-queries are composed.

In SQL, to form a statement, sub-queries are nested (embedded).
In nGQL the shell style `PIPE (|)` is introduced.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
YIELD follow._dst AS dstid, $$.player.name AS Name |\
GO FROM $-.dstid OVER follow;

+-------------+
| follow._dst |
+-------------+
| "player101" |
+-------------+
```

If there is no `YIELD` clause to define the output, the destination vertex ID is returned by default. If a YIELD clause is applied, the output is defined by the YIELD clause.

You must define aliases in the `YIELD` clause for the reference operator `$-` to use, just like `$-.dstid` in the preceding example.

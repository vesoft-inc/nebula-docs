# Comparison operators

| Name  | Description |
|:----|:----:|
| `=`  | Assign a value   |
| `/`  | Division operator   |
| `==`   | Equal operator   |
| `!=`,  `<>`  | Not equal operator   |
| `<`   | Less than operator   |
| `<=`   | Less than or equal operator   |
| `-`   | Minus operator   |
| `%`   | Modulo operator   |
| `+`   | Addition operator   |
| `*`   | Multiplication operator   |
| `-`   | Change the sign of the argument   |
|`IS NULL` | NULL test TODO(coding) |
| `IS NOT NULL` | not NULL test TODO(coding) |

Comparison operations result in a value of _true_ and _false_.

> Tips: Comparability between values of different types is often undefined.

* `==`

Equal. String comparisons are case-sensitive. Values of different types are not equal.

> **NOTE:** The equality operator is `==` in nGQL and is `=` in openCypher.

```ngql
nebula> YIELD 'A' == 'a';
+--------+
| (A==a) |
+--------+
| false  |
+--------+

nebula> YIELD '2' == 2;
+--------+
| (2==2) |
+--------+
| false  |
+--------+
```

* `>`

Greater than:

```ngql
nebula> YIELD 3 > 2;
+-------+
| (3>2) |
+-------+
| true  |
+-------+

nebula>  WITH 4 AS one, 3 AS two RETURN one > two AS result
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| true   |
+--------+
```

* `>=`

Greater than or equal to:

```ngql
nebula> YIELD 2 >= "2";
+--------+
| (2>=2) |
+--------+
| false  |
+--------+

nebula> YIELD 2 >= 2;
+--------+
| (2>=2) |
+--------+
| true   |
+--------+
```

* `<`

Less than:

```ngql
nebula> YIELD 2.0 < 1.9;
+---------+
| (2<1.9) |
+---------+
| false   |
+---------+
```

* `<=`

Less than or equal to:

```ngql
nebula> YIELD 0.11 <= 0.11;
+--------------+
| (0.11<=0.11) |
+--------------+
| true         |
+--------------+
```

* `!=`

Not equal:

```ngql
nebula> YIELD 1 != '1';
+--------+
| (1!=1) |
+--------+
| true   |
+--------+
```

* `NULL`

```ngql
nebula> TODO
```

# List operators

List operators are:

- concatenating lists: `+`
- checking if an element exists in a list: `IN`
- accessing an element(s) in a list using the subscript operator: `[]`

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> YIELD [1,2,3,4,5]+[6,7] AS myList
+-----------------------+
| myList                |
+-----------------------+
| [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] |
+-----------------------+

```

nebula> WITH [2, 3, 4, 5] AS numberlist \
UNWIND numberlist AS number \
WITH number \
WHERE number IN [2, 3, 8] \
RETURN number

WITH ['Anne', 'John', 'Bill', 'Diane', 'Eve'] AS names
RETURN names[1..3] AS result

```

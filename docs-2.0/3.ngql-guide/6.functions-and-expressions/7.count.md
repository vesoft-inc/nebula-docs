# count()

The `count()` function calculates the number of the specified values or rows.

## Group and count the number of values

You can use `count(*)` and `GROUP BY` together to group and count the number of specific values.

### Example 1

```nGQL
nebula> GO FROM "player101" OVER follow BIDIRECT YIELD $$.player.name as Name | \
        GROUP BY $-.Name YIELD $-.Name, count(*);
+---------------------+----------+
| $-.Name             | COUNT(*) |
+---------------------+----------+
| "Dejounte Murray"   | 1        |
+---------------------+----------+
| "LaMarcus Aldridge" | 2        |
+---------------------+----------+
| "Tim Duncan"        | 2        |
+---------------------+----------+
| "Marco Belinelli"   | 1        |
+---------------------+----------+
| "Manu Ginobili"     | 1        |
+---------------------+----------+
| "Boris Diaw"        | 1        |
+---------------------+----------+
Got 6 rows (time spent 4056/4684 us)
```

The statement in the preceding example searches for:

* People whom `player101` follows.
* People who follow `player101`.

And retrieves two columns:

* `$-.Name`, the names of the people.
* `COUNT(*)`, how many times the names show up.

Because there are no duplicate names in the `nba` dataset, the number `2` in the result shows that the person in that row and `player101` have followed each other.

### Example 2

```nGQL
nebula> MATCH (v:player) RETURN v.age as Age | \
        GROUP BY $-.Age YIELD $-.Age AS Age, count(*) AS Number | \
        ORDER BY Number DESC;
+-----+--------+
| Age | Number |
+-----+--------+
| 30  | 4      |
+-----+--------+
| 34  | 4      |
+-----+--------+
| 33  | 4      |
+-----+--------+
| 29  | 4      |
+-----+--------+
| 31  | 3      |
+-----+--------+
...
Got 25 rows (time spent 2697/3343 us)
```

The statement in the preceding example retrieves the age distribution of the players in the dataset.

## Count the rows in the result

You can use `count(*)` in a `YIELD` clause behind a pipe. `count(*)` counts the number of rows returned by the statement before the pipe.

```nGQL
nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:"Tim Duncan"}) -- (v2) \
        RETURN DISTINCT v2 | YIELD count(*);
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
| 11       |
+----------+
Got 1 rows (time spent 4935/5482 us)
```

## count(null)

Counting NULL returns 0.

```nGQL
nebula> YIELD count(null);
+-----------------+
| COUNT(__NULL__) |
+-----------------+
| 0               |
+-----------------+
Got 1 rows (time spent 202/691 us)
```

# Conditional expressions

This topic describes the conditional functions supported by NebulaGraph.

## CASE

The `CASE` expression uses conditions to filter the parameters. nGQL provides two forms of `CASE` expressions just like openCypher: the simple form and the generic form.

The `CASE` expression will traverse all the conditions. When the first condition is met, the `CASE` expression stops reading the conditions and returns the result. If no conditions are met, it returns the result in the `ELSE` clause. If there is no `ELSE` clause and no conditions are met, it returns `NULL`.

### The simple form of CASE expressions

- Syntax

```ngql
CASE <comparer>
WHEN <value> THEN <result>
[WHEN ...]
[ELSE <default>]
END
```

!!! caution

    Always remember to end the `CASE` expression with an `END`.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `comparer` | A value or a valid expression that outputs a value. This value is used to compare with the `value`.         |
| `value`    | It will be compared with the `comparer`. If the `value` matches the `comparer`, then this condition is met. |
| `result`   | The `result` is returned by the `CASE` expression if the `value` matches the `comparer`.                    |
| `default`  | The `default` is returned by the `CASE` expression if no conditions are met.                                |

- Examples

```ngql
nebula> RETURN \
        CASE 2+3 \
        WHEN 4 THEN 0 \
        WHEN 5 THEN 1 \
        ELSE -1 \
        END \
        AS result;
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 1      |
+--------+
```

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
        YIELD properties($$).name AS Name, \
        CASE properties($$).age > 35 \
        WHEN true THEN "Yes" \
        WHEN false THEN "No" \
        ELSE "Nah" \
        END \
        AS Age_above_35;
+-----------------+--------------+
| Name            | Age_above_35 |
+-----------------+--------------+
| "Tony Parker"   | "Yes"        |
| "Manu Ginobili" | "Yes"        |
+-----------------+--------------+
```

### The generic form of CASE expressions

- Syntax

```ngql
CASE
WHEN <condition> THEN <result>
[WHEN ...]
[ELSE <default>]
END
```

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `condition` | If the `condition` is evaluated as true, the `result` is returned by the `CASE` expression. |
| `result`    | The `result` is returned by the `CASE` expression if the `condition` is evaluated as true.  |
| `default`   | The `default` is returned by the `CASE` expression if no conditions are met.                |

- Examples

```ngql
nebula> YIELD \
        CASE WHEN 4 > 5 THEN 0 \
        WHEN 3+4==7 THEN 1 \
        ELSE 2 \
        END \
        AS result;
+--------+
| result |
+--------+
| 1      |
+--------+
```

```ngql
nebula> MATCH (v:player) WHERE v.player.age > 30 \
        RETURN v.player.name AS Name,  \
        CASE \
        WHEN v.player.name STARTS WITH "T" THEN "Yes" \
        ELSE "No" \
        END \
        AS Starts_with_T;
+---------------------+---------------+
| Name                | Starts_with_T |
+---------------------+---------------+
| "Tim Duncan"        | "Yes"         |
| "LaMarcus Aldridge" | "No"          |
| "Tony Parker"       | "Yes"         |
+---------------------+---------------+
```

### Differences between the simple form and the generic form

To avoid the misuse of the simple form and the generic form, it is important to understand their differences. The following example can help explain them.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER follow \
        YIELD properties($$).name AS Name, properties($$).age AS Age, \
        CASE properties($$).age \
        WHEN properties($$).age > 35 THEN "Yes" \
        ELSE "No" \
        END \
        AS Age_above_35;
+-----------------+-----+--------------+
| Name            | Age | Age_above_35 |
+-----------------+-----+--------------+
| "Tony Parker"   | 36  | "No"         |
| "Manu Ginobili" | 41  | "No"         |
+-----------------+-----+--------------+
```

The preceding `GO` query is intended to output `Yes` when the player's age is above 35. However, in this example, when the player's age is 36, the actual output is not as expected: It is `No` instead of `Yes`.

This is because the query uses the `CASE` expression in the simple form, and a comparison between the values of `$$.player.age` and `$$.player.age > 35` is made. When the player age is 36:

* The value of `$$.player.age` is `36`. It is an integer.

* `$$.player.age > 35` is evaluated to be `true`. It is a boolean.

The values of `$$.player.age` and `$$.player.age > 35` do not match. Therefore, the condition is not met and `No` is returned.

## coalesce()

coalesce() returns the first not null value in all expressions.

Syntax: `coalesce(<expression_1>[,<expression_2>...])`

- Result type: Same as the original element.

Example:

```ngql
nebula> RETURN coalesce(null,[1,2,3]) as result;
+-----------+
| result    |
+-----------+
| [1, 2, 3] |
+-----------+
nebula> RETURN coalesce(null) as result;
+----------+
| result   |
+----------+
| __NULL__ |
+----------+
```

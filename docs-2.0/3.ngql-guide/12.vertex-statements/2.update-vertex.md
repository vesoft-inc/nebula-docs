# UPDATE VERTEX

```ngql
UPDATE VERTEX <vid> SET <update_columns>
[WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>]
```

Use `UPDATE VERTEX` to update properties on a vertex. The `UPDATE VERTEX` statement only updates one tag of a vertex at a time.

Nebula Graph supports compare-and-set (CAS) operation.

> **NOTE:** `WHEN` and `YIELD` are optional.

- `vid` is the ID of the vertex to be updated.
- `update_columns` is the properties of the vertex to be updated. For example, `tag1.col1 = $^.tag2.col2 + 1` means to update `tag1.col1` to `tag2.col2+1`.

    > **NOTE:**Â  `$^` indicates the vertex to be updated.

- `condition` is some constraints. Only when the constraints are met, `UPDATE` is executed successfully. `condition` supports expression operations.
- `columns` is the columns to be returned. `YIELD` returns the latest updated values.

Consider the following example:

```ngql
nebula> UPDATE VERTEX "player100" SET player.age = $^.player.age + 1 \
WHEN $^.player.name == "Tony Parker" \
YIELD $^.player.name AS name, $^.player.age AS age;

+-------+-----+
| name  | age |
+-------+-----+
| "Tim" | 42  |
+-------+-----+
```

There is one tag in vertex "player100", namely player.

```ngql
nebula> UPDATE VERTEX "team200" SET player.name = 'Cory Joseph' WHEN $^.team.name == 'Rocket';
[ERROR (-8)]: Storage Error: Invalid Update col or yield col.
```

`UPDATE VERTEX` does not support multiple tags, so an error occurs here.

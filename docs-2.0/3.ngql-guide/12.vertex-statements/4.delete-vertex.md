# DELETE VERTEX

```ngql
DELETE VERTEX <vid> [, <vid> ...]
```

Use `DELETE VERTEX` to delete vertices and the related incoming and outgoing edges of the vertices. The `DELETE VERTEX` statement deletes one vertex or multiple vertices at a time. You can use `DELETE VERTEX` together with pipe. For more information about pipe, see [Pipe operator](../5.operators/4.pipe.md).

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> DELETE VERTEX "team1";
```

This query deletes the vertex whose ID is "team1".

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER serve YIELD serve._dst AS id | DELETE VERTEX $-.id;
```

This query shows that you can use `DELETE VERTEX` together with pipe.

Nebula Graph traverses the incoming and outgoing edges related to the vertices and deletes them all. Then Nebula Graph deletes information related to the vertices.

# DELETE VERTEX

The `DELETE VERTEX` statement deletes vertices and the related incoming and outgoing edges of the vertices.

The `DELETE VERTEX` statement deletes one vertex or multiple vertices at a time. You can use `DELETE VERTEX` together with pipes. For more information about pipe, see [Pipe operator](../5.operators/4.pipe.md).

<!--
!!! note

    - `DELETE VERTEX`是直接删除点和关联的边。

    - `DELETE TAG`是删除指定点上的指定Tag。当点上只有一个Tag时，执行`DELETE TAG`会删除点，但是不会删除关联的边。
-->

## Syntax

```ngql
DELETE VERTEX <vid> [, <vid> ...];
```

## Examples

This query deletes the vertex whose ID is "team1".

```ngql
nebula> DELETE VERTEX "team1";
```

This query shows that you can use `DELETE VERTEX` together with pipe to delete vertices.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM "player100" OVER serve WHERE serve.start_year == "2021" YIELD serve._dst AS id | DELETE VERTEX $-.id;
```

## Delete the process and the related edges

Nebula Graph traverses the incoming and outgoing edges related to the vertices and deletes them all. Then Nebula Graph deletes the vertices.

!!! caution

    * Atomic deletion is not supported during the entire process for now. Please retry when a failure occurs to avoid partial deletion, which will cause pendent edges.
    * Deleting a supernode takes a lot of time. To avoid connection timeout before the deletion is complete, you can modify the parameter `--storage_client_timeout_ms` in `nebula-graphd.conf` to extend the timeout period.

# UPSERT VERTEX

`UPSERT` is a combination of `UPDATE` and `INSERT`. Use `UPSERT VERTEX` to update properties of a vertex if it exists or insert a new vertex if it does not exist.

!!! note

    An `UPSERT VERTEX` statement can only update properties on **ONE TAG** of a vertex.

The performance of `UPSERT` is much lower than that of `INSERT`, because `UPSERT` is a read-modify-write serialization operation at the partition level.

!!! danger

    Don't use `UPSERT` for scenarios with highly concurrent writes. Use `UPDATE` or `INSERT` instead.

## Syntax

```ngql
UPSERT VERTEX ON <tag> <vid>
SET <update_prop>
[WHEN <condition>]
[YIELD <output>]
```

| Field | Required | Description | Example |
|-|-|-|-|
| `ON <tag>` | Yes | Specifies the tag of the vertex. The properties to be updated must be on this tag. | `ON player` |
| `<vid>` | Yes | Specifies the ID of the vertex to be updated or inserted. | `"player100"` |
| `SET <update_prop>` | Yes | Specifies the properties to be updated and how they will be updated. | `SET age = age +1` |
| `WHEN <condition>` | No | Specifies the filter conditions. | `WHEN name == "Tim"` |
|`YIELD <output>`| No | Specifies the output format of the statement. | `YIELD name AS Name` |

## Insert a vertex if it does not exist

If a vertex does not exist, it is created no matter the conditions in the `WHEN` clause are met or not, and the `SET` clause always takes effect. The property values of the new vertex depends on:

* How the `SET` clause is defined
* The default value of the properties

For example, if:

* The vertex to be inserted will have properties `name` and `age` based on tag `player`.
* The `SET` clause specifies that `age = 30`.

Then the property values in different cases are listed as follows:

| Are `WHEN` conditions met | If properties has default values | Value of `name` | Value of `age` |
| - | - | - | - |
| Yes | Yes | The default value | `30` |
| Yes | No | `NULL` | `30` |
| No | Yes | The default value | `30` |
| No | No | `NULL` | `30` |

Here are some examples:

```ngql
// Check if the following three vertices exists.
nebula> FETCH PROP ON * "player666", "player667", "player668";
Empty set

// The result Empty set indicates that the vertices don't exist.

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player666" \
        SET age = 30 \
        WHEN name == "Joe" \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+----------+----------+
| Name     | Age      |
+----------+----------+
| __NULL__ | 30       |
+----------+----------+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player666" SET age = 31 WHEN name == "Joe" YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+----------+-----+
| Name     | Age |
+----------+-----+
| __NULL__ | 30  |
+----------+-----+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player667" \
        SET age = 31 \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+----------+-----+
| Name     | Age |
+----------+-----+
| __NULL__ | 31  |
+----------+-----+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player668" \
        SET name = "Amber", age = age + 1 \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+---------+----------+
| Name    | Age      |
+---------+----------+
| "Amber" | __NULL__ |
+---------+----------+
```

In the last query of the preceding example, since `age` has no default value, when the vertex is created, `age` is `NULL`, and `age = age + 1` does not take effect. But if it has a default value, `age = age + 1` in the `SET` clause will take effect. For example:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG player_with_default(name string, age int DEFAULT 20);
Execution succeeded

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player_with_default "player101" \
        SET age = age + 1 \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;

+----------+-----+
| Name     | Age |
+----------+-----+
| __NULL__ | 21  |
+----------+-----+
```

## Update a vertex if it exists

If the vertex exists and the `WHEN` conditions are met, the vertex is updated.

```ngql
nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player101";
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| vertices_                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| ("player101" :player{age: 42, name: "Tony Parker"}) |
+-----------------------------------------------------+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player101" \
        SET age = age + 2 \
        WHEN name == "Tony Parker" \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+---------------+-----+
| Name          | Age |
+---------------+-----+
| "Tony Parker" | 44  |
+---------------+-----+
```

If the vertex exists and the `WHEN` conditions are not met, the update does not take effect.

```ngql
nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player101";
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| vertices_                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| ("player101" :player{age: 44, name: "Tony Parker"}) |
+-----------------------------------------------------+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player101" \
        SET age = age + 2 \
        WHEN name == "Someone else" \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+---------------+-----+
| Name          | Age |
+---------------+-----+
| "Tony Parker" | 44  |
+---------------+-----+
```

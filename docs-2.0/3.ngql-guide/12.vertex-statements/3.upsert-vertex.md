# UPSERT VERTEX

The `UPSERT` statement is a combination of `UPDATE` and `INSERT`. You can use `UPSERT VERTEX` to update the properties of a vertex if it exists or insert a new vertex if it does not exist.

!!! note

    An `UPSERT VERTEX` statement can only update the properties on **ONE TAG** of a vertex.

The performance of `UPSERT` is much lower than that of `INSERT` because `UPSERT` is a read-modify-write serialization operation at the partition level.

!!! danger

    Don't use `UPSERT` for scenarios with highly concurrent writes. You can use `UPDATE` or `INSERT` instead.

## Syntax

```ngql
UPSERT VERTEX ON <tag> <vid>
SET <update_prop>
[WHEN <condition>]
[YIELD <output>]
```

| Parameter           | Required | Description                                                                        | Example              |
|---------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `ON <tag>`          | Yes      | Specifies the tag of the vertex. The properties to be updated must be on this tag. | `ON player`          |
| `<vid>`             | Yes      | Specifies the ID of the vertex to be updated or inserted.                          | `"player100"`        |
| `SET <update_prop>` | Yes      | Specifies the properties to be updated and how they will be updated.               | `SET age = age +1`   |
| `WHEN <condition>`  | No       | Specifies the filter conditions.                                                   | `WHEN name == "Tim"` |
| `YIELD <output>`    | No       | Specifies the output format of the statement.                                      | `YIELD name AS Name` |

## Insert a vertex if it does not exist

If a vertex does not exist, it is created no matter the conditions in the `WHEN` clause are met or not, and the `SET` clause always takes effect. The property values of the new vertex depend on:

* How the `SET` clause is defined.

* Whether the property has a default value.

For example, if:

* The vertex to be inserted will have properties `name` and `age` based on the tag `player`.

* The `SET` clause specifies that `age = 30`.

Then the property values in different cases are listed as follows:

| Are `WHEN` conditions met | If properties have default values | Value of `name`   | Value of `age` |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Yes                       | Yes                               | The default value | `30`           |
| Yes                       | No                                | `NULL`            | `30`           |
| No                        | Yes                               | The default value | `30`           |
| No                        | No                                | `NULL`            | `30`           |

Here are some examples:

```ngql
// This query checks if the following three vertices exist. The result "Empty set" indicates that the vertices do not exist.
nebula> FETCH PROP ON * "player666", "player667", "player668" YIELD properties(vertex);
+--------------------+
| properties(VERTEX) |
+--------------------+
+--------------------+
Empty set

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player666" \
        SET age = 30 \
        WHEN name == "Joe" \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+----------+----------+
| Name     | Age      |
+----------+----------+
| __NULL__ | 30       |
+----------+----------+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player666" \
        SET age = 31 \
        WHEN name == "Joe" \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+----------+-----+
| Name     | Age |
+----------+-----+
| __NULL__ | 30  |
+----------+-----+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player667" \
        SET age = 31 \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+----------+-----+
| Name     | Age |
+----------+-----+
| __NULL__ | 31  |
+----------+-----+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player668" \
        SET name = "Amber", age = age + 1 \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+---------+----------+
| Name    | Age      |
+---------+----------+
| "Amber" | __NULL__ |
+---------+----------+
```

In the last query of the preceding examples, since `age` has no default value, when the vertex is created, `age` is `NULL`, and `age = age + 1` does not take effect. But if `age` has a default value, `age = age + 1` will take effect. For example:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS player_with_default(name string, age int DEFAULT 20);
Execution succeeded

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player_with_default "player101" \
        SET age = age + 1 \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;

+----------+-----+
| Name     | Age |
+----------+-----+
| __NULL__ | 21  |
+----------+-----+
```

## Update a vertex if it exists

If the vertex exists and the `WHEN` conditions are met, the vertex is updated.

```ngql
nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player101" YIELD properties(vertex);
+--------------------------------+
| properties(VERTEX)             |
+--------------------------------+
| {age: 36, name: "Tony Parker"} |
+--------------------------------+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player101" \
        SET age = age + 2 \
        WHEN name == "Tony Parker" \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+---------------+-----+
| Name          | Age |
+---------------+-----+
| "Tony Parker" | 38  |
+---------------+-----+
```

If the vertex exists and the `WHEN` conditions are not met, the update does not take effect.

```ngql
nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player101" YIELD properties(vertex);
+--------------------------------+
| properties(VERTEX)             |
+--------------------------------+
| {age: 38, name: "Tony Parker"} |
+--------------------------------+

nebula> UPSERT VERTEX ON player "player101" \
        SET age = age + 2 \
        WHEN name == "Someone else" \
        YIELD name AS Name, age AS Age;
+---------------+-----+
| Name          | Age |
+---------------+-----+
| "Tony Parker" | 38  |
+---------------+-----+
```

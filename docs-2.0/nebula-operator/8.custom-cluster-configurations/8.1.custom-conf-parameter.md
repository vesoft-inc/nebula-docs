# Customize configuration parameters for a NebulaGraph cluster

Meta, Storage, and Graph services in a NebulaGraph Cluster have their configurations, which are defined as `config` in the YAML file of the CR instance (NebulaGraph cluster) you created. The settings in `config` are mapped and loaded into the ConfigMap of the corresponding service in Kubernetes.

!!! note

    It is not available to customize configuration parameters for NebulaGraph Clusters deployed with Helm.

The structure of `config` is as follows.

```
Config map[string]string `json:"config,omitempty"`
```
## Prerequisites

You have created a NebulaGraph cluster. For how to create a cluster with Kubectl, see [Create a cluster with Kubectl](../3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.1create-cluster-with-kubectl.md). 


## Steps

The following example uses a cluster named `nebula` and the cluster's configuration file named `nebula_cluster.yaml` to show how to set `config` for the Graph service in a NebulaGraph cluster.

1. Run the following command to access the edit page of the `nebula` cluster.
   
  ```bash
  kubectl edit nebulaclusters.apps.nebula-graph.io nebula
  ```

2. Add `enable_authorize` and `auth_type` under `spec.graphd.config`.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1
  kind: NebulaCluster
  metadata:
    name: nebula
    namespace: default
  spec:
    graphd:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 1
      image: vesoft/nebula-graphd
      version: {{nebula.tag}}
      storageClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: fast-disks
      config: // Custom configuration parameters for the Graph service in a cluster.
        "enable_authorize": "true"
        "auth_type": "password"
  ...
  ```

3. Run `kubectl apply -f nebula_cluster.yaml` to push your configuration changes to the cluster.

  After customizing the parameters `enable_authorize` and `auth_type`, the configurations in the corresponding ConfigMap (`nebula-graphd`) of the Graph service will be overwritten.

# Balance storage data after scaling out

After the Storage service is scaled out, you can decide whether to balance the data in the Storage service. 

The scaling out of the Nebula Graph's Storage service is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the status of all pods is changed to `Ready`. In the second stage, the commands of `BALANCE DATA`和`BALANCE LEADER` are executed to balance data. These two stages decouple the scaling out process of the controller replica from the balancing data process, so that you can choose to perform the data balancing operation during low traffic period. The decoupling of the scaling out process from the balancing process can effectively reduce the impact on online services during data migration.

You can define whether to balance data automatically or not with the parameter `enableAutoBalance` in the configuration file of the CR instance of the cluster you created.

## Prerequisites

You have created a Nebula Graph cluster. For how to create a cluster with Kubectl, see [Create a cluster with Kubectl](../3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.1create-cluster-with-kubectl.md). 

## Steps

The following example uses a cluster named `nebula` to show how to set `enableAutoBalance`.

1. Run the following command to access the edit page of the `nebula` cluster.
   
  ```bash
  kubectl edit nebulaclusters.apps.nebula-graph.io nebula
  ```

2. Add `enableAutoBalance` and set its value to `true` under `spec.storaged`.
   
  ```yaml

    storaged:
      enableAutoBalance: true   //Set its value to true which means storage data will be balanced after the Storage service is scaled out.
      dataVolumeClaim:

        storageClassName: fast-disks
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:

  ...    
  ```

  - When the value of `enableAutoBalance` is set to `true`, the Storage data will be automatically balanced after the Storage service is scaled out.

  - When the value of `enableAutoBalance` is set to `false`, the Storage data will not be automatically balanced after the Storage service is scaled out.

  - When the `enableAutoBalance` parameter is not set, the system will not automatically balance Storage data by default after the Storage service is scaled out.

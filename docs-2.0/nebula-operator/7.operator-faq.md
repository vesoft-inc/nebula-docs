# FAQ

## Does NebulaGraph Operator support the v1.x version of NebulaGraph?

No, because the v1.x version of NebulaGraph does not support DNS, and NebulaGraph Operator requires the use of DNS.

## Is cluster stability guaranteed if using local storage?

There is no guarantee. Using local storage means that the Pod is bound to a specific node, and NebulaGraph Operator does not currently support failover in the event of a failure of the bound node.

## How to ensure the stability of a cluster when scaling the cluster?

It is suggested to back up data in advance so that you can roll back data in case of failure.

## Is the replica in the Operator docs the same as the replica in the NebulaGraph core docs?

They are different concepts. A replica in the Operator docs indicates a pod replica in K8s, while a replica in the core docs is a replica of a NebulaGraph storage partition.

# FAQ

## Does Nebula Operator support the v1.x version of Nebula Graph?

## Does Nebula Operator support the rolling upgrade feature for Nebula Graph clusters?

Not available at the moment.

## Is cluster stability guaranteed if using local storage?

There is no guarantee. Using local storage means that the Pod is bound to a specific node, and Nebula Operator does not currently support failover in the event of a failure of the bound node.

It is suggested to back up data in advance so that you can roll back data in case of failure.

# FAQ

## Does Nebula Operator support the v1.x version of Nebula Graph?

No, because the v1.x version of Nebula Graph does not support DNS, and Nebula Operator requires the use of DNS.

## Does Nebula Operator support the rolling upgrade feature for Nebula Graph clusters?

Nebula Operator currently supports cluster upgrading from version 2.5.x to version 2.6.x.

## Is cluster stability guaranteed if using local storage?

There is no guarantee. Using local storage means that the Pod is bound to a specific node, and Nebula Operator does not currently support failover in the event of a failure of the bound node.

## How to ensure the stability of a cluster when scaling the cluster?

It is suggested to back up data in advance so that you can roll back data in case of failure.

## Is the replica in the Operator docs the same as the replica in the Nebula Graph core docs?

They are different concepts. A replica in the Operator docs indicates a pod replica in K8s, while a replica in the core docs is a replica of a Nebula Graph storage partition.

## Create clusters

The following example shows how to create a NebulaGraph cluster by creating a cluster named `nebula`.

1. Create a file named `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml`.

  The file contents for a NebulaGraph Enterprise cluster are as follows:

  ```yaml
  # Contact our sales team to get a complete NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition cluster YAML example.

  apiVersion: apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1
  kind: NebulaCluster
  metadata:
    annotations:
      nebula-graph.io/owner: test
    name: nebula
  spec:
    graphd:
      readinessProbe:
        failureThreshold: 3
        httpGet:
          path: /status
          port: 19669
          scheme: HTTP
        initialDelaySeconds: 40
        periodSeconds: 10
        successThreshold: 1
        timeoutSeconds: 10
      image: reg.vesoft-inc.com/vesoft-ent/nebula-graphd
      logVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: fast-disks
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 500Mi
      version: {{nebula.tag}}   # The {{nebula.tag}} is exclusively available in the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    imagePullSecrets:
    - name: vesoft
    metad:
      license:
        secretName: nebula-license
        licenseKey: nebula.license
    ...       
  ```

  !!! enterpriseonly

        Make sure that you have access to NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition images before pulling the image. For details, contact our sales team ([inqury@vesoft.com](mailto:inqury@vesoft.com))


2. Configure the license for the Enterprise Edition cluster.

  !!! enterpriseonly

      - This step is required only for creating a NebulaGraph Graph Enterprise Edition cluster.

      - Ignore this step if you are creating a NebulaGraph Community Edition cluster.


  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic nebula-license --from-file=nebula.license
  ```

  To check the details of the license, run the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl get secrets nebula-license -o yaml
  ```

3. Create a NebulaGraph cluster.

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  nebulacluster.apps.nebula-graph.io/nebula created
  ```

4. Check the status of the NebulaGraph cluster.
   
  ```bash
  kubectl get nebulaclusters.apps.nebula-graph.io nebula
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  NAME     GRAPHD-DESIRED   GRAPHD-READY   METAD-DESIRED   METAD-READY   STORAGED-DESIRED   STORAGED-READY   AGE
  nebula   1                1              1               1             3                  3                86s
  ```

## Scaling clusters

- The cluster scaling feature is for NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition only. 

{{ ent.ent_begin }}

- Scaling a NebulaGraph cluster for Enterprise Edition is supported only with NebulaGraph Operator version 1.1.0 or later. 

You can modify the value of `replicas` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml` to scale a NebulaGraph cluster.

### Scale out clusters

The following shows how to scale out a NebulaGraph cluster by changing the number of Storage services to 5:

1. Change the value of the `storaged.replicas` from `3` to `5` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml`.

  ```yaml
    storaged:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 5
      image: vesoft/nebula-storaged
      version: {{nebula.tag}}
      dataVolumeClaims:
      - resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: fast-disks
      - resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: fast-disks
      logVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: fast-disks
    reference:
      name: statefulsets.apps
      version: v1
    schedulerName: default-scheduler
  ```

2. Run the following command to update the NebulaGraph cluster CR.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
  ```
  
3. Check the number of Storage services.

  ```bash
  kubectl  get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=nebula
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  nebula-graphd-0     1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-metad-0      1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-0   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-2   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-3   1/1     Running   0          5m
  nebula-storaged-4   1/1     Running   0          5m
  ```

  As you can see above, the number of Storage services is scaled up to 5.

### Scale in clusters

The principle of scaling in a cluster is the same as scaling out a cluster. You scale in a cluster if the numeric value of the `replicas` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml` is changed smaller than the current number. For more information, see the **Scale out clusters** section above.

!!! caution

    NebulaGraph Operator currently only supports scaling Graph and Storage services and does not support scale Meta services.

## Delete clusters

Run the following command to delete a NebulaGraph cluster with Kubectl:

```bash
kubectl delete -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
```

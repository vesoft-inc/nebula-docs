## Create clusters

The following example shows how to create a Nebula Graph cluster by creating a cluster named `nebula`.

1. Create a file named `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml`.

  The file contents are as follows:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1
  kind: NebulaCluster
  metadata:
    name: nebula
  spec:
    graphd:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 1
      image: vesoft/nebula-graphd
      version: v2.5.1
      service:
        type: NodePort
        externalTrafficPolicy: Local
      storageClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
    metad:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 1
      image: vesoft/nebula-metad
      version: v2.5.1
      storageClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
    storaged:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 3
      image: vesoft/nebula-storaged
      version: v2.5.1
      storageClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
    reference:
      name: statefulsets.apps
      version: v1
    schedulerName: default-scheduler
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  ```

  The parameters in the file are described as follows:

  | Parameter    | Default value  | Description    |
  | :---- | :--- | :--- |
  | `metadata.name`              | -                                                            | The name of the created Nebula Graph cluster. |

  | `spec.graphd.storageClaim`   | -                                                            | The storage configurations for the Graphd service.        |
  | `spec.metad.replicas`        | `1`                                                          | The numeric value of replicas of the Metad service.          |

  | `spec.storaged.storageClaim` | -                                                            | The storage configurations for the Storaged service.       |
  | `spec.reference.name`        | -                                                            | The name of the dependent controller.           |

2. Create a Nebula Graph cluster.

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  nebulacluster.apps.nebula-graph.io/nebula created
  ```

3. Check the status of the Nebula Graph cluster.
   
  ```bash
  kubectl get nebulaclusters.apps.nebula-graph.io nebula
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  NAME             GRAPHD-DESIRED   GRAPHD-READY   METAD-DESIRED   METAD-READY   STORAGED-DESIRED   STORAGED-READY   AGE
  nebula-cluster   1                1              1               1             3                  3                31h
  ```

## Scaling clusters

You can modify the value of `replicas` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml` to scale a Nebula Graph cluster.

### Scale out clusters

The following shows how to scale out a Nebula Graph cluster by changing the number of Storage services to 5:

1. Change the value of the `storaged.replicas` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml` from `3` to `5`.

  ```yaml
    storaged:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 5
      image: vesoft/nebula-storaged
      version: v2.5.1
      storageClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: fast-disks
  ```

2. Run the following command to update the Nebula Graph cluster CR.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
  ```
  
3. Check the number of Storage services.

  ```bash
  kubectl  get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=nebula
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  nebula-graphd-0     1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-metad-0      1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-0   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-2   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-3   1/1     Running   0          5m
  nebula-storaged-4   1/1     Running   0          5m
  ```

  As you can see above, the number of Storage services is scaled up to 5.

### Scale in clusters

The principle of scaling in a cluster is the same as scaling out a cluster. You scale in a cluster if the numeric value of the `replicas` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml` is changed smaller than the current number. For more information, see the **Scale out clusters** section above.

!!! caution

    Nebula Operator currently only supports scaling Graph and Storage services and does not support scale Meta services.

## Delete clusters

Run the following command to delete a Nebula Graph cluster with Kubectl:

```bash
kubectl delete -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
```

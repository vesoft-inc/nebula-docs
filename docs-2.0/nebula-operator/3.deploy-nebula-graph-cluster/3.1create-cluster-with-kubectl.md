## Create clusters

The following example shows how to create a Nebula Graph cluster by creating a cluster named `nebula`.

1. Create a file named `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml`.

  The file contents are as follows:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps.nebula-graph.io/v1alpha1
  kind: NebulaCluster
  metadata:
    name: nebula
  spec:
    graphd:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 1
      image: vesoft/nebula-graphd
      version: {{nebula.branch}}
      service:
        type: NodePort
        externalTrafficPolicy: Local
      logVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
    metad:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 1
      image: vesoft/nebula-metad
      version: {{nebula.branch}}
      dataVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
      logVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
    storaged:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 3
      image: vesoft/nebula-storaged
      version: {{nebula.branch}}
      dataVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
      logVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
    reference:
      name: statefulsets.apps
      version: v1
    schedulerName: default-scheduler
    imagePullPolicy: Always
  ```

  The parameters in the file are described as follows:

2. Create a Nebula Graph cluster.

  ```bash
  kubectl create -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  nebulacluster.apps.nebula-graph.io/nebula created
  ```

3. Check the status of the Nebula Graph cluster.
   
  ```bash
  kubectl get nebulaclusters.apps.nebula-graph.io nebula
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  NAME     GRAPHD-DESIRED   GRAPHD-READY   METAD-DESIRED   METAD-READY   STORAGED-DESIRED   STORAGED-READY   AGE
  nebula   1                1              1               1             3                  3                86s
  ```

## Scaling clusters

!!! enterpriseonly

    The cluster scaling feature is for Nebula Graph Enterprise Edition only. Scaling a Nebula Graph cluster for Enterprise Edition is supported only with Nebula Operator version 1.1.0 or later. 

You can modify the value of `replicas` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml` to scale a Nebula Graph cluster.

### Scale out clusters

The following shows how to scale out a Nebula Graph cluster by changing the number of Storage services to 5:

1. Change the value of the `storaged.replicas` from `3` to `5` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml`.

  ```yaml
    storaged:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
      replicas: 5
      image: vesoft/nebula-storaged
      version: {{nebula.branch}}
      dataVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
      logVolumeClaim:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
        storageClassName: gp2
    reference:
      name: statefulsets.apps
      version: v1
    schedulerName: default-scheduler
  ```

2. Run the following command to update the Nebula Graph cluster CR.

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
  ```
  
3. Check the number of Storage services.

  ```bash
  kubectl  get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/cluster=nebula
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  nebula-graphd-0     1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-metad-0      1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-0   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-1   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-2   1/1     Running   0          2m
  nebula-storaged-3   1/1     Running   0          5m
  nebula-storaged-4   1/1     Running   0          5m
  ```

  As you can see above, the number of Storage services is scaled up to 5.

### Scale in clusters

The principle of scaling in a cluster is the same as scaling out a cluster. You scale in a cluster if the numeric value of the `replicas` in `apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml` is changed smaller than the current number. For more information, see the **Scale out clusters** section above.

!!! caution

    Nebula Operator currently only supports scaling Graph and Storage services and does not support scale Meta services.

## Delete clusters

Run the following command to delete a Nebula Graph cluster with Kubectl:

```bash
kubectl delete -f apps_v1alpha1_nebulacluster.yaml
```

# What is Nebula Operator

## Concept of Nebula Operator

Nebula Operator is a tool to automate the deployment, operation, and maintenance of [Nebula Graph](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula) clusters on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). Building upon the excellent scalability mechanism of Kubernetes, Nebula Graph introduced its operation and maintenance knowledge into the Kubernetes system, which makes Nebula Graph a real [cloud-native graph database](https://www.nebula-cloud.io/).

## How it works

For resource types that do not exist within Kubernetesï¼Œyou can register them by adding custom API objects. The common way is to use the [CustomResourceDefinition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions).

Nebula Operator abstracts the deployment management of Nebula Graph clusters as a CRD. By combining multiple built-in API objects including StatefulSet, Service, and ConfigMap, the routine management and maintenance of a Nebula Graph cluster are coded as a control loop in the Kubernetes system. When a CR instance is submitted, Nebula Operator drives database clusters to the final state according to the control process.

## Features of Nebula Operator

The following features are already available in Nebula Operator:

- **Deploy and uninstall clusters**: Nebula Operator simplifies the process of deploying and uninstalling clusters for users. Nebula Operator allows you to quickly create, update, or delete a Nebula Graph cluster by simply providing the corresponding CR file. For more information, see [Deploy Nebula Graph Clusters with Kubectl](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.1create-cluster-with-kubectl.md) or [Deploy Nebula Graph Clusters with Helm](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.2create-cluster-with-helm.md).
  
- **Scale clusters**: Nebula Operator calls Nebula Graph's native scaling interfaces in a control loop to implement the scaling logic. You can simply perform scaling operations with YAML configurations and ensure the stability of data. For more information, see [Scale clusters with Kubectl](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.1create-cluster-with-kubectl.md) or [Scale clusters with Helm](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.2create-cluster-with-helm.md).
  
- **Cluster Upgrade**: Nebula Operator supports cluster upgrading from version {{operator.upgrade_from}} to version {{operator.upgrade_to}}.
  
- **Self-Healing**: Nebula Operator calls interfaces provided by Nebula Graph clusters to dynamically sense cluster service status. Once an exception is detected, Nebula Operator performs fault tolerance. For more information, see [Self-Healing](5.operator-failover.md).
  
- **Balance Scheduling**: Based on the scheduler extension interface, the scheduler provided by Nebula Operator evenly distributes Pods in a Nebula Graph cluster across all nodes.

## Limitations

### Version limitations

Nebula Operator does not support the v1.x version of Nebula Graph. Nebula Operator version and the corresponding Nebula Graph version are as follows:

| Nebula Operator version | Nebula Graph version |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1.1.0| 3.0.0 ~ 3.1.x |
| 1.0.0| 3.0.0 ~ 3.1.x |
| 0.9.0| 2.5.x ~ 2.6.x |
|0.8.0|2.5.x|

!!! Compatibility "Legacy version compatibility"

    - The 1.x version Nebula Operator is not compatible with Nebula Graph of version below v3.x.
    - Starting from Nebula Operator 0.9.0, logs and data are stored separately. Using Nebula Operator 0.9.0 or later versions to manage a Nebula Graph 2.5.x cluster created with Operator 0.8.0 can cause compatibility issues. You can backup the data of the Nebula Graph 2.5.x cluster and then create a 2.6.x cluster with Operator 0.9.0.

### Feature limitations

Nebula Operator currently only supports manual scaling of Nebula Graph clusters, and does not support automatic scaling of Nebula Graph clusters.

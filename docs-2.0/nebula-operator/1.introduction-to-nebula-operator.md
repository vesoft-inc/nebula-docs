# What is Nebula Operator

## Concept of Nebula Operator

Nebula Operator is a tool to automate the deployment, operation, and maintenance of [NebulaGraph](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula) clusters on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). Building upon the excellent scalability mechanism of Kubernetes, NebulaGraph introduced its operation and maintenance knowledge into the Kubernetes system, which makes NebulaGraph a real [cloud-native graph database](https://www.nebula-cloud.io/).

## How it works

For resource types that do not exist within Kubernetesï¼Œyou can register them by adding custom API objects. The common way is to use the [CustomResourceDefinition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions).

Nebula Operator abstracts the deployment management of NebulaGraph clusters as a CRD. By combining multiple built-in API objects including StatefulSet, Service, and ConfigMap, the routine management and maintenance of a NebulaGraph cluster are coded as a control loop in the Kubernetes system. When a CR instance is submitted, Nebula Operator drives database clusters to the final state according to the control process.

## Features of Nebula Operator

The following features are already available in Nebula Operator:

- **Deploy and uninstall clusters**: Nebula Operator simplifies the process of deploying and uninstalling clusters for users. Nebula Operator allows you to quickly create, update, or delete a NebulaGraph cluster by simply providing the corresponding CR file. For more information, see [Deploy NebulaGraph Clusters with Kubectl](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.1create-cluster-with-kubectl.md) or [Deploy NebulaGraph Clusters with Helm](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.2create-cluster-with-helm.md).
  
- **Scale clusters**: Nebula Operator calls NebulaGraph's native scaling interfaces in a control loop to implement the scaling logic. You can simply perform scaling operations with YAML configurations and ensure the stability of data. For more information, see [Scale clusters with Kubectl](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.1create-cluster-with-kubectl.md#_3) or [Scale clusters with Helm](3.deploy-nebula-graph-cluster/3.2create-cluster-with-helm.md#_2).
  
- **Cluster Upgrade**: Nebula Operator supports cluster upgrading from version 2.5.x to version 2.6.x.
  
- **Self-Healing**: Nebula Operator calls interfaces provided by NebulaGraph clusters to dynamically sense cluster service status. Once an exception is detected, Nebula Operator performs fault tolerance. For more information, see [Self-Healing](5.operator-failover.md).
  
- **Balance Scheduling**: Based on the scheduler extension interface, the scheduler provided by Nebula Operator evenly distributes Pods in a NebulaGraph cluster across all nodes.

## Limitations

### Version limitations

Nebula Operator does not support the v1.x version of NebulaGraph. Nebula Operator version and the corresponding NebulaGraph version are as follows:

| Nebula Operator version | NebulaGraph version |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| {{operator.release}}| 2.5.x ~ 2.6.x |
|0.8.0|2.5.x|

### Feature limitations

Nebula Operator currently only supports manual scaling of NebulaGraph clusters, and does not support automatic scaling of NebulaGraph clusters.

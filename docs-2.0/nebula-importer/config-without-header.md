# Configuration without Header

For CSV files without header, you need to set `withHeader` to `false` in the configuration file, indicating that the CSV file contains only data (excluding the header of the first row). You may also need to set the data type and corresponding columns.

## Sample files

The following is an example of a CSV file without header:

- sample of vertex

  Example data for `student_without_header.csv`:

  ```csv
  student100,Monica,16,female
  student101,Mike,18,male
  student102,Jane,17,female
  ```

  The first column is the vertex ID, followed by the properties `name`, `age`, and `gender`.

- sample of edge

  Example data for `follow_without_header.csv`:

  ```csv
  student100,student101,0,92.5
  student101,student100,1,85.6
  student101,student102,2,93.2
  student100,student102,1,96.2
  ```

  The first two columns are the start vertex ID and destination vertex ID, respectively. The third column is rank, and the fourth column is property `degree`.

```

!!! Note

    - The sequence numbers of the columns in the CSV file start from 0, that is, the sequence numbers of the first column are 0, and the sequence numbers of the second column are 1.

    - The data type of the vertex ID must be the same as the data type of the statement in `clientSettings.postStart.commands` that creates the graph space.

    - If the index field is not specified, the CSV file must comply with the following rules:

      + In the vertex data file, the first column must be the vertex ID, followed by the properties, and must correspond to the order in the configuration file.

      + In the side data file, the first column must be the start vertex ID, the second column must be the destination vertex ID, if `withRanking` is `true`, the third column must be the rank value, and the following columns must be properties, and must correspond to the order in the configuration file.

## VID

`VID` is short for vertex identifier.

In NebulaGraph, vertices are identified with vertex identifiers (i.e. `VID`s). 
The VID can be an int64 or a fixed length string.
When inserting a vertex, you must specify a `VID` for it. 

You can also call `hash()` to generate an int64 VID if the graph has less than one billion vertices.

> `VID` must be unique in a graph space.

That is, in the same graph space, two vertices that have the same `VID` are considered as the same vertex.

In addition, one `VID` can have multiple `TAG`s. E.g., One person (`VID`) can have two roles (`tags`).

Two `VID`s in two different graph spaces are totally independent of each other.

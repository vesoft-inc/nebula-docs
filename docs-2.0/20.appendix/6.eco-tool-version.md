!!! compatibility

    The core release number naming rule is `X.Y.Z`, which means `Major version X`, `Medium version Y`, and `Minor version Z`. The upgrade requirements for the client are:

    - Upgrade the core from `X.Y.Z1` to `X.Y.Z2`: It means that the core is fully forward compatible and is usually used for bugfixes. It is recommended to upgrade the minor version of the core as soon as possible. At this time, the client can stay **not upgraded**.
    
    - Upgrade the core from `X.Y1.*` to `X.Y2.*`: It means that there is some incompatibility of API, syntax, and return value. It is usually used to add functions, improve performance, and optimize code. The client needs to be upgraded to `X.Y2.*`.
    
    - Upgrade the core from `X1.*.*` to `X2.*.*`: It means that there is a major incompatibility in storage formats, API, syntax, etc. You need to use tools to upgrade the core data. The client must be upgraded.

    - The default core and client do not support downgrade: You cannot downgrade from `X.Y.Z2` to `X.Y.Z1`.
 
    - The release cycle of a `Y` version is about 6 months, and its maintenance and support cycle is 6 months.
    
    - The version released at the beginning of the year is usually named `X.0.0`, and in the middle of the year, it is named `X.5.0`.
    
    - The file name contains `RC` to indicate an unofficial version (`Release Candidate`) that is only used for preview. Its maintenance period is only until the next RC or official version is released. Its client, data compatibility, etc. are not guaranteed.
    
    - The files with `nightly`, `SNAPSHOT`, or date are the nightly versions. There is no quality assurance and maintenance period.

## Nebula Studio

Nebula Studio (Studio for short) is a graph database visualization tool that can be accessed through the Web. It can be used with Nebula Graph DBMS to provide one-stop services such as composition, data import, writing nGQL queries, and graph exploration.

!!! Note

    The release of the Studio is independent of Nebula Graph core, and its naming method is also not the same as the core naming rules.

## FAQ about Nebula Graph licenses

### Are the Dashboard/Explorer/Nebula Graph Enterprise Edition licenses the same?

No, the licenses of Dashboard, Explorer, and Nebula Graph Enterprise Editions are independent of each other and cannot be used interchangeably.

### During the validity period of the Nebula Graph Enterprise Edition license, after replacing the enterprise edition Meta with the community edition Meta, can the community edition Meta be used with the enterprise edition Graph and Storage?

No, mixed deployments of the enterprise edition services and the community edition services are not supported.

### After the Nebula Graph Enterprise Edition license expires, is it possible that copy the data in the `data` directory and paste it to the same directory of Nebula Graph Community Edition, and then use Nebula Graph services as normal? 

Yes, it is possible. The data of the Enterprise Edition can be used in the Community Edition. The pasted data will only work properly in the services deployed in the Community Edition. Mixed deployments of the enterprise edition services and the community edition services are not supported. For example, the mixed deployment of the enterprise edition Meta service and the community edition Graph and Storage services is not supported.

### Is there any message before the license expires, and how to renew the license after it expires?

The system will send expiration notifications before the license expires.

The notification time before the license expires is different for the full version license and the trial version license.

- For the full version license:

  - Within 30 days before the license expires or on the day the license expires, there is an expiration reminder when Nebula Graph/Dashboard/Explorer is started.

  - There is a 14-day buffer period after expiration. During the buffer period, you will receive expiration notifications and can continue using Nebula Graph/Dashboard/Explorer. After the buffer period ends, the corresponding service will be down and cannot be started. 

- For the trial version license: 

  - Within 7 days before the license expires or on the day the license expires, there is an expiration reminder when Nebula Graph/Dashboard/Explorer is started.

  - There is no buffer period after expiration. Once the license expires, the corresponding service will be down and cannot be started.

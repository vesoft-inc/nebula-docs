  - There is a 14-day buffer period after expiration. During the buffer period, you will receive expiration notifications and can continue using Nebula Graph/Dashboard/Explorer. After the buffer period ends, the corresponding service will be down and cannot be started. 

- For the trial version license: 

  - Within 7 days before the license expires or on the day the license expires, there is an expiration reminder when Nebula Graph/Dashboard/Explorer is started.

  - There is no buffer period after expiration. Once the license expires, the corresponding service will be down and cannot be started.

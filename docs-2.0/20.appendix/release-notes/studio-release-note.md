# NebulaGraph Studio release notes

- Feature
  - Support [schema drafting](../../nebula-studio/quick-start/draft.md). The Schema is designed directly by dragging and dropping on the canvas. The vertex and edge relationship is more intuitive and supports applying the schema to a graph space with one click.

- Enhancement
  - The welcome page provides some demo datasets.
  - The console supports adding comments with `//`.
  - The favorites folder contents can be saved on the server.
  - Support searching graph space names in the graph space list.
  - Added a white screen page for the crash.

- Bugfix
  - Fixed the bug that importing Int8/16/32 and fixed_string data failed.

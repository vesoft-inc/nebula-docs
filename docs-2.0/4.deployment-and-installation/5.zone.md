# Manage Zones

!!! enterpriseonly

    This feature is only available in the NebulaGraph Enterprise Edition.

NebulaGraph supports the zone feature to manage Storage services in a cluster to achieve resource isolation, which is known as logical rack.

## Background

Within NebulaGraph, you can set up multiple Zones, with each Zone containing one or more Storage nodes. When creating a graph space, the system automatically recognizes these set Zones and stores graph space data on the Storage nodes within these Zones.

It's important to note that when creating a graph space, you need to specify the number of replicas for data partitioning. At this point, **the specified number of partition replicas and the number of set Zones must be equal, otherwise, the graph space cannot be created**. This is because NebulaGraph evenly distributes the replicas of every graph space partition across these set Zones.

Since each Zone contains a complete set of graph space data partitions, at least one Storage node is required within each Zone to store these data partitions.

The partition replicas in NebulaGraph achieve strong consistency through the [Raft](../1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service.md#raft_1) protocol. It's recommended to use an odd number of partition replicas, and therefore, it's also suggested to set an odd number of Zones.

Taking the following picture as an example, when creating a graph space (S1), the data is partitioned into 3 partitions, with 3 replicas for each partition, and the number of Zones is also 3. Six machines hosting the Storage service are paired up and added to these 3 Zones. When creating the graph space, NebulaGraph stores the 3 replicas of each partition evenly across zone1, zone2, and zone3, and each Zone contains a complete set of graph space data partitions (Part1, Part2, and Part3).

To reduce cost of cross-Zone network traffic, and increase data transfer speed (Intra-zone network usually has a lower latency than inter-zone network), you can configure the Graph service to prioritize intra-zone data access. Each Graphd will then prioritize to access the partition replica in the same zone as specified by Graphd if there is any. As an example, suppose Graphd A and Graphd B are located in zone1, Graphd C and Graphd D are in zone2, and Graphd E is in zone3. You can configure Graphd A and Graphd B to prioritize accessing data in zone1, Graphd C and Graphd D to prioritize accessing data in zone2, and Graphd E to prioritize accessing data in zone3. This helps reduce the cost of cross-zone network traffic and improves data transfer speed.

<!-- To be released next version 
In cases where data retrieval fails due to a Storage node failure in a specific Zone, you can configure the Graph service to read leader replica data across zones to ensure data availability. For instance, if machine B experiences a failure, causing Graph A to be unable to read the Follower replica data of Part3 in zone1, you can configure Graph A to read the Leader replica data of Part3 in zone3, thus ensuring data availability.

## Scenarios

- Resource isolation. You can create a graph space on specified storage nodes to achieve resource isolation.
- Rolling upgrade. You need to stop one or more servers to update them, and then put them into use again until all servers in the cluster are updated to the new version.
- Cost saving. Allocate graph space data to different Zones, and control the client to access the replica data in the specified Zone to reduce traffic consumption and improve access efficiency.

## Syntax

- Before enabling the Zone feature, clear any existing data in the cluster. See **Enabling Zone** for details.
- Each Storage node must belong to one, and only one, Zone. However, a Zone can have multiple Storage nodes. Storage nodes should outnumber or equal Zones.
- The number of Zones must equal the number of partition replicas; otherwise, the graph space cannot be created.
- The number of Zones is recommended to be odd.
- Adjusting the number of Zones isn't allowed.
- Zone name modifications are unsupported.

Add the Storage services to a new zone.

1. In the configuration file `nebula-metad.conf` of the Meta service, set `--zone_list` to Zone names to be added, such as `--zone_list=zone1, zone2, zone3`.

Example:

        Once the value of `--zone_list` is configured and the Meta service is started, it cannot be modified, otherwise, the Meta service will fail to restart. 

  !!! note

      - The number of Zones specified in `--zone_list` is recommended to be odd and must be less than or equal to the number of Storage nodes. When `--zone_list` is empty, it indicates that the Zone feature is disabled.
      - Consider the replica settings when setting the number of Zones, since the number of Zones should match the replica count. For example, with 3 replicas, you must have 3 Zones.
      - If the name of a Zone contains special characters (excluding underscores), reserved keywords, or starts with a number, you need to enclose the Zone name in backticks (`) when specifying the Zone name in a query statement; the Zone name cannot contain English periods (.); multiple Zone names must be separated by commas (,).
   
  For more information about the Meta configuration file, see [Meta service configuration](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md).

2. Restart the Meta service.


## Specify intra Zone data access

1. Enable the Zone feature. For details, see **Enable Zone** above.
2. In the configuration file `nebula-graphd.conf` of the Graph service, add the following configuration:
  
  1. Set the `--assigned_zone` to the name of the Zone where the Graphd is assigned, such as `--assigned_zone=zone1`.
   
    !!! note
      
        - Different Graph services can set different values for `--assigned_zone`, but the value of `--assigned_zone` must be one of the values in `--zone_list`. In production, it is recommended to use the actual zone that a Graphd locates to reduce management complexity. Of course, it must be within the `zone_list`. Otherwise, intra zone reading may not take effect.
        - The value of `--assigned_zone` is a string and does not support English commas (,).
        - When `--assigned_zone` is empty, it means reading from leader replicas.
  
  2. Set `--prioritize_intra_zone_reading` to `true` to prioritize intra zone data reading. When reading fails in the Zone specified by `--assigned_zone`, an error occurs depending on the value of `stick_to_intra_zone_on_failure`. 

    !!! caution

        It is recommended that the values of `--prioritize_intra_zone_reading` in different Graph services be consistent, otherwise, the load of Storage nodes will be unbalanced and unknown risks will occur.

  For details on the Graph configuration, see [Graph service configuration](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/3.graph-config.md).

3. Restart the Graph service.
   

## Zone-related commands

!!! note

    Make sure that the Zone feature is enabled and the `--zone_list` is configured before executing Zone-related commands. For details, see **Enable Zone** above.

### View all Zone information

```ngql
nebula> SHOW ZONES;
+--------+-----------------+------+
| Name   | Host            | Port |
+--------+-----------------+------+
| "az1"  | "192.168.8.111" | 9779 |
| "az1"  | "192.168.8.112" | 9779 |
| "az2"  | "192.168.8.113" | 9779 |
| "az3"  | "192.168.8.114" | 9779 | 
+--------+-----------------+------+
```

Run `SHOW ZONES` in the current graph space to view all Zone information. The Zone information includes the name of the Zone, the IP address (or domain name) and the port number of the storage node in the Zone.

### View the specified Zone

```ngql
DESCRIBE ZONE <zone_name>;
DESC ZONE <zone_name>;
```

For example:

```ngql
nebula> DESC ZONE az1
+-----------------+------+
| Hosts           | Port |
+-----------------+------+
| "192.168.8.111" | 7779 |
| "192.168.8.112" | 9779 |
+-----------------+------+
```

### Create a space in the specified Zones

The syntax for creating a graph space within a Zone is the same as in [Creating Graph Space](../3.ngql-guide/9.space-statements/1.create-space.md). 

However, during graph space creation, the system automatically recognizes the `--zone_list` value from the Meta configuration file. If this value is not empty and the number of Zones matches the partition replica count specified by `replica_factor`, the graph space's replicas will be evenly distributed across the Zones in `--zone_list`. If the specified replica count doesn't match the number of Zones, graph space creation will fail.

If the value of `--zone_list` is empty, the Zone feature is not enabled, and the graph space will be created without specifying Zones.

### Check the Zones for the specified graph space

```ngql
DESC SPACE <space_name>;
```

For example:

```ngql
nebula> DESC SPACE my_space_1
+----+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------+------------+--------------------+---------+---------+
| ID | Name         | Partition Number | Replica Factor | Charset | Collate    | Vid Type           | Zones   | Comment |
+----+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------+------------+--------------------+---------+---------+
| 22 | "my_space_1" | 10               | 1              | "utf8"  | "utf8_bin" | "FIXED_STRING(30)" | ["az1"] |         |
+----+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------+------------+--------------------+---------+---------+
```

### Add Storage nodes to the specified Zone

```ngql
ADD HOSTS <ip>:<port> [,<ip>:<port> ...] INTO ZONE <zone_name>;
```

- After enabling the Zone feature, you must include the `INTO ZONE` clause when executing the `ADD HOSTS` command; otherwise, adding a Storage node will fail.
- A Storage node can belong to only one Zone, but a single Zone can encompass multiple different Storage nodes.


For example: 

```ngql
nebula> ADD HOSTS 192.168.8.111:9779,192.168.8.112:9779 INTO ZONE az1;
```

### Balance the Zone replicas

```ngql
BALANCE DATA IN ZONE;
```

!!! note

    Specify a space before executing this command.

After enabling the Zone feature, run `BALANCE DATA IN ZONE` to balance the partition replicas within each Zone.

For example: 

```ngql
nebula> USE my_space_1;
nebula> BALANCE DATA IN ZONE;
```

### Migrate partitions from the Storage nodes in the specified Zones to other Storage nodes 

```ngql
BALANCE DATA IN ZONE REMOVE <ip>:<port> [,<ip>:<port> ...]
```

!!! note

    - You must specify a space before executing this command.
    - Make sure that the number of other Storage nodes is sufficient to meet the set number of partition replicas. When the number of Storage nodes is insufficient, the removal will fail. Run `SHOW JOBS <job_id>` to view the status of the removal task. When `FINISHED` is returned, the removal task is completed.


For example: 

```ngql
nebula> USE my_space_1;
nebula> BALANCE DATA IN ZONE REMOVE 192.168.8.111:9779;
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 34         |
+------------+

# To view the status of the removal task:
nebula> SHOW JOBS 34
+--------+----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| Job Id | Command        | Status     | Start Time                 | Stop Time                  |
+--------+----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| 33     | "DATA_BALANCE" | "FINISHED" | 2023-09-01T08:03:16.000000 | 2023-09-01T08:03:16.000000 |
+--------+----------------+------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+
```

### Drop Storage nodes from the specified Zone 

```ngql
DROP HOSTS <ip>:<port> [,<ip>:<port> ...];
```

### SHOW ZONES

    - You cannot directly drop a Storage node that is in use. You need to first drop the associated graph space before dropping the Storage nodes. See [drop space](../3.ngql-guide/9.space-statements/5.drop-space.md) for details.
    - Make sure the number of remaining Storage nodes outnumbers or equals that of Zones after removing a node, otherwise, the graph space will be unavailable.

For example: 

```ngql
SHOW ZONES;
```


### MERGE ZONE...INTO

Merge Storage services in multiple zones into a new zone.

!!! note

    The distribution of partitions will be checked during the merge to prevent different partition replicas from being distributed in the same zone.

<!-- balance-3.1
!!! note

    Use the [BALANCE](../synchronization-and-migration/2.balance-syntax.md) command to balance the load after Merging the Storage services.
-->

```ngql
MERGE ZONE "<zone_name>" [,"<zone_name>" ...] INTO "<new_zone_name>";
```

Example:

```ngql
MERGE ZONE "default_zone_192.168.10.100_9779","default_zone_192.168.10.101_9779","default_zone_192.168.10.102_9779" INTO "merge_zone";
```

### DIVIDE ZONE

Divide Storage services in a zone into multiple new zones.

<!-- balance-3.1
!!! note

    Use the [BALANCE](../synchronization-and-migration/2.balance-syntax.md) command to balance the load after dividing the Storage services.
-->

```ngql
DIVIDE ZONE "<zone_name>" INTO "<new_zone_name>"(<ip>:<port>) ["<new_zone_name>"(<ip>:<port>) ...];
```

Example:

```ngql
DIVIDE ZONE "merge_zone" INTO "zone1"(192.168.10.100:9779) "zone2"(192.168.10.101:9779) "zone3"(192.168.10.102:9779);
```

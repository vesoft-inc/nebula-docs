# Install Nebula Graph by compiling the source code

Installing Nebula Graph from the source code allows you to customize the compiling and installation settings and test the latest features.

## Prerequisites

- Users have to prepare correct resources described in [Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running Nebula Graph](../1.resource-preparations.md).

- The host to be installed with Nebula Graph has access to the Internet.

## Installation steps

!!! Note

    Starting with the Nebula Graph {{ nebula.release }} release, the code repositories for Nebula-Graph, Nebula-Storage, and Nebula-Common have been merged into the Nebula code repository, so the compilation steps are different from those in previous releases.

1. Use Git to clone the source code of Nebula Graph to the host.

  - [Recommended] To install Nebula Graph {{nebula.release}}, run the following command.

    ```bash
    $ git clone --branch {{nebula.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git
    ```

  - To install the latest developing release, run the following command to clone the source code from the master branch.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git
    ```

2. Make the `nebula` directory the current working directory.

  ```bash
  $ cd nebula
  ```

3. Create a `build` directory and make it the current working directory.

  ```bash
  $ mkdir build && cd build
  ```

4. Generate Makefile with CMake.

  !!! note

        The installation path is `/usr/local/nebula` by default. To customize it, add the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path>` CMake variable in the following command.

        For more information about CMake variables, see [CMake variables](#cmake_variables).

  ```bash
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/nebula -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  ```

5. Compile Nebula Graph.

  !!! Note

        Check [Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running Nebula Graph](../1.resource-preparations.md).

    To speed up the compiling, use the `-j` option to set a concurrent number `N`. It should be $\min(\text{CPU}core number,\frac{the_memory_size(GB)}{2})$.

  ```bash
  $ make -j{N} # E.g., make -j2
  ```

6. Install Nebula Graph.

  ```bash
  $ sudo make install
  ```

7. The configuration files in the `etc/` directory (`/usr/local/nebula/etc` by default) are references. Users can create their own configuration files accordingly. If you want to use the scripts in the `script` directory to start, stop, restart, and kill the service, and check the service status, the configuration files have to be named as `nebula-graph.conf`, `nebula-metad.conf`, and `nebula-storaged.conf`.

## Update the master branch

The source code of the master branch changes frequently. If the corresponding Nebula Graph release is installed, update it in the following steps.

1. In the `nebula` directory, run `git pull upstream master` to update the source code.

2. In the `nebula/build` directory, run `make -j{N}` and `make install` again.

## CMake variables

### Usage of CMake variables

```bash
$ cmake -D<variable>=<value> ...
```

The following CMake variables can be used at the configure (cmake) stage to adjust the compiling settings.

### CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` specifies the path where the service modules, scripts, configuration files are installed. The default path is `/usr/local/nebula`.

### ENABLE_WERROR

`ENABLE_WERROR` is `ON` by default and it makes all warnings into errors. You can set it to `OFF` if needed.

### ENABLE_TESTING

`ENABLE_TESTING` is `ON` by default and unit tests are built with the Nebula Graph services. If you just need the service modules, set it to `OFF`.

### ENABLE_ASAN

`ENABLE_ASAN` is `OFF` by default and the building of ASan (AddressSanitizer), a memory error detector, is disabled. To enable it, set `ENABLE_ASAN` to `ON`. This variable is intended for Nebula Graph developers.

### CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

Nebula Graph supports the following building types of `MAKE_BUILD_TYPE`:

- `Debug`

   The default value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. It indicates building Nebula Graph with the debug info but not the optimization options.

- `Release`

   It indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options but not the debug info.

- `RelWithDebInfo`

   It indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options and the debug info.

- `MinSizeRel`

   It indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options for controlling the code size but not the debug info.

### CMAKE_C_COMPILER/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER

Usually, CMake locates and uses a C/C++ compiler installed in the host automatically. But if your compiler is not installed at the standard path, or if you want to use a different one, run the command as follows to specify the installation path of the target compiler:

```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path_to_gcc/bin/gcc> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path_to_gcc/bin/g++> ..
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path_to_clang/bin/clang> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path_to_clang/bin/clang++> ..
```

### ENABLE_CCACHE

`ENABLE_CCACHE` is `ON` by default and Ccache (compiler cache) is used to speed up the compiling of Nebula Graph.

To disable `ccache`, setting `ENABLE_CCACHE` to `OFF` is not enough. On some platforms, the `ccache` installation hooks up or precedes the compiler. In such a case, you have to set an environment variable `export CCACHE_DISABLE=true` or add a line `disable=true` in `~/.ccache/ccache.conf` as well. For more information, see the [ccache official documentation](https://ccache.dev/manual/3.7.6.html).

### NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT

`NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT` specifies the path where the third party software is installed. By default it is `/opt/vesoft/third-party`.

## Examine problems

If the compiling fails, we suggest you:

1. Check whether the operating system release meets the requirements and whether the memory and hard disk space are sufficient.

2. Check whether the [third-party](../1.resource-preparations/#_5) is installed correctly.

3. Use `make -j1` to reduce the compiling concurrency.

# Install NebulaGraph by compiling the source code

Installing NebulaGraph from the source code allows you to customize the compiling and installation settings and test the latest features.

## Prerequisites

- Users have to prepare correct resources described in [Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running NebulaGraph](../1.resource-preparations.md).

  !!! note
    
        Compilation of NebulaGraph offline is not currently supported.

- The host to be installed with NebulaGraph has access to the Internet.

{{ ent.ent_begin }}
- For NebulaGraph Enterprise, you must have the [license key](../../9.about-license/1.license-overview.md#licensing-process) loaded in [LM](../../9.about-license/2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md).
{{ ent.ent_end }}

## Installation steps

1. Use Git to clone the source code of NebulaGraph to the host.

  - [Recommended] To install NebulaGraph {{nebula.release}}, run the following command.

    ```bash
    $ git clone --branch {{nebula.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git
    ```

  - To install the latest developing release, run the following command to clone the source code from the master branch.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git
    ```

2. Go to the `nebula/third-party` directory, and run the `install-third-party.sh` script to install the third-party libraries.

  ```bash
  $ cd nebula/third-party
  $ ./install-third-party.sh
  ```

3. Go back to the `nebula` directory, create a directory named `build`, and enter the directory.

  ```bash
  $ cd ..
  $ mkdir build && cd build
  ```

4. Generate Makefile with CMake.

  !!! note

        The installation path is `/usr/local/nebula` by default. To customize it, add the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path>` CMake variable in the following command.

        For more information about CMake variables, see [CMake variables](#cmake_variables).

  ```bash
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/nebula -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  ```

5. Compile NebulaGraph.

  !!! Note

        Check [Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running NebulaGraph](../1.resource-preparations.md).

    To speed up the compiling, use the `-j` option to set a concurrent number `N`. It should be $\min(\text{CPU}core number,\frac{the_memory_size(GB)}{2})$.

  ```bash
  $ make -j{N} # E.g., make -j2
  ```

6. Install NebulaGraph.

  ```bash
  $ sudo make install
  ```

  {{ ent.ent_begin }}
7. (Enterprise only) For Enterprise Edition, set the value of `license_manager_url` to the host IP and port number `9119` where the license management tool is located in the Meta service configuration file of NebulaGraph (`nebula-metad.conf`), e.g. `192.168.8.100:9119`.
  {{ ent.ent_end }}

!!! note

    The configuration files in the `etc/` directory (`/usr/local/nebula/etc` by default) are references. Users can create their own configuration files accordingly. If you want to use the scripts in the `script` directory to start, stop, restart, and kill the service, and check the service status, the configuration files have to be named as `nebula-graph.conf`, `nebula-metad.conf`, and `nebula-storaged.conf`.

## Update the master branch

The source code of the master branch changes frequently. If the corresponding NebulaGraph release is installed, update it in the following steps.

1. In the `nebula` directory, run `git pull upstream master` to update the source code.

2. In the `nebula/build` directory, run `make -j{N}` and `make install` again.

## CMake variables

### Usage of CMake variables

```bash
$ cmake -D<variable>=<value> ...
```

The following CMake variables can be used at the configure (cmake) stage to adjust the compiling settings.

### CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` specifies the path where the service modules, scripts, configuration files are installed. The default path is `/usr/local/nebula`.

### ENABLE_WERROR

`ENABLE_WERROR` is `ON` by default and it makes all warnings into errors. You can set it to `OFF` if needed.

### ENABLE_TESTING

`ENABLE_TESTING` is `ON` by default and unit tests are built with the NebulaGraph services. If you just need the service modules, set it to `OFF`.

### ENABLE_ASAN

`ENABLE_ASAN` is `OFF` by default and the building of ASan (AddressSanitizer), a memory error detector, is disabled. To enable it, set `ENABLE_ASAN` to `ON`. This variable is intended for NebulaGraph developers.

### CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

NebulaGraph supports the following building types of `MAKE_BUILD_TYPE`:

- `Debug`

   The default value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. It indicates building NebulaGraph with the debug info but not the optimization options.

- `Release`

   It indicates building NebulaGraph with the optimization options but not the debug info.

- `RelWithDebInfo`

   It indicates building NebulaGraph with the optimization options and the debug info.

- `MinSizeRel`

   It indicates building NebulaGraph with the optimization options for controlling the code size but not the debug info.

### ENABLE_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE

`ENABLE_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` is `OFF` by default. When set to `ON` and include-what-you-use is installed on the system, the system reports redundant headers contained in the project source code during makefile generation.

### NEBULA_USE_LINKER

Specifies the program linker on the system. The available values are:

- `bfd`, the default value, indicates that ld.bfd is applied as the linker.
- `lld`, indicates that ld.lld, if installed on the system, is applied as the linker.
- `gold`, indicates that ld.gold, if installed on the system, is applied as the linker.

### CMAKE_C_COMPILER/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER

Usually, CMake locates and uses a C/C++ compiler installed in the host automatically. But if your compiler is not installed at the standard path, or if you want to use a different one, run the command as follows to specify the installation path of the target compiler:

```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path_to_gcc/bin/gcc> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path_to_gcc/bin/g++> ..
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path_to_clang/bin/clang> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path_to_clang/bin/clang++> ..
```

### ENABLE_CCACHE

`ENABLE_CCACHE` is `ON` by default and Ccache (compiler cache) is used to speed up the compiling of NebulaGraph.

To disable `ccache`, setting `ENABLE_CCACHE` to `OFF` is not enough. On some platforms, the `ccache` installation hooks up or precedes the compiler. In such a case, you have to set an environment variable `export CCACHE_DISABLE=true` or add a line `disable=true` in `~/.ccache/ccache.conf` as well. For more information, see the [ccache official documentation](https://ccache.dev/manual/3.7.6.html).

### NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT

`NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT` specifies the path where the third party software is installed. By default it is `/opt/vesoft/third-party`.

## Examine problems

If the compiling fails, we suggest you:

1. Check whether the operating system release meets the requirements and whether the memory and hard disk space are sufficient.

2. Check whether the [third-party](../1.resource-preparations.md) is installed correctly.

3. Use `make -j1` to reduce the compiling concurrency.

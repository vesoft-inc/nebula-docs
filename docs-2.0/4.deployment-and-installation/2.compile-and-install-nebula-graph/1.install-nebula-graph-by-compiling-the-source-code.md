# Install Nebula Graph by compiling the source code

Installing Nebula Graph from the source code allows you to customize the compiling and installation settings and test the latest features.

## Prerequisites

- You have prepared the necessary resources described in [Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running Nebula Graph](../1.resource-preparations.md).

- You can access the Internet from the host you plan to install Nebula Graph.

- The console is not complied or packaged with Nebula Graph server binaries. You can install [nebula-console](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-console) by yourself.

## How to install

1. Use Git to clone the source code of Nebula Graph to your host.

   - To install the latest developing version, run the following command to download the source code from the `master` branch.

       ```bash
       $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph.git
       ```

   - To install a specific release version, use the `--branch` option to specify the correct branch. For example, to install 2.0.0, run the following command.

       ```bash
       $ git clone --branch v2.0.0 https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph.git
       ```

2. Make the `nebula-graph` directory the current working directory.

    ```bash
    $ cd nebula-graph
    ```

3. Create a `build` directory and make it the current working directory.

    ```bash
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    ```

4. Generate the Makefile with CMake.

  !!! note

      - The installation path is `/usr/local/nebula` by default. To customize it, add the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/install/path/` CMake variable in the following command.

      - For more information about CMake variables, see [CMake variables](#cmake_variables).

   - If you are installing the latest developing version and has cloned the `master` branch in step 1, run the following command.

       ```bash
       $ cmake -DENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE=on -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
       ```

   - If you are installing a specific release version and has cloned the corresponding branch in step 1, use the `-DNEBULA_COMMON_REPO_TAG` and `-DNEBULA_STORAGE_REPO_TAG` options to specify the correct branches of the [nebula-common](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-common "GitHub page of the nebula-common repository") and [nebula-storage](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-storage "GitHub page of the nebula-storage repository") repositories. For example, to install release version 2.0.0, run the following command.

       ```bash
       $ cmake -DENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE=on -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
       -DNEBULA_COMMON_REPO_TAG=v2.0.0 -DNEBULA_STORAGE_REPO_TAG=v2.0.0 ..
       ```

5. Compile Nebula Graph.

    To speed up the compiling, use the `-j` option to set a concurrent number `N`. It should be `min(MEM/2, CPU)`, where `MEM` is the memory size in GB, and `CPU` is the core number.

    ```bash
    $ make -j{N} # E.g., make -j4
    ```

    This step will take about 20 minutes on a VM with four cores of `Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8260M CPU @ 2.30GHz`.

6. Install Nebula Graph.

    ```bash
    $ sudo make install-all
    ```

7. [Optional] Update the source code of the `master` branch. (It changes frequently.)

    1. In the `nebula-graph/` directory, you can use `git pull upstream master` to update the source code.

    2. In `nebula-graph/modules/common/`  and `nebula-graph/modules/storage/`, run `git pull upstream master` separately.

    3. In `nebula-graph/build/`, `make` and `make install[-all]` again.

## CMake variables

Usage of CMake variables:

```bash
$ cmake -D<variable>=<value> ...
```

The following CMake variables can be used at the configure (cmake) stage to adjust the compiling settings.

### ENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE

Starting from the 2.0 pre-release, Nebula Graph uses two separated github repositories of compute and storage. The `ENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE` variable is set to `OFF` by default so that the storage service is not installed together with the graph service.

If you are deploying Nebula Graph on a single host for testing, you can set `ENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE` to `ON` to download and install the storage service automatically.

### CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` specifies the path where the service modules, scripts, configuration files are installed. The default path is `/usr/local/nebula`.

### ENABLE_WERROR

`ENABLE_WERROR` is `ON` by default and it makes all warnings into errors. You can set it to `OFF` if needed.

### ENABLE_TESTING

`ENABLE_TESTING` is `ON` by default and unit tests are built with the Nebula Graph services. If you just need the service modules, set it to `OFF`.

### ENABLE_ASAN

`ENABLE_ASAN` is `OFF` by default and the building of ASan (AddressSanitizer), a memory error detector, is disabled. To enable it, set `ENABLE_ASAN` to `ON`. This variable is intended for Nebula Graph developers.

### CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

Nebula Graph supports the following building types:

- `Debug`, the default value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the debug info but not the optimization options.
- `Release`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options but not the debug info.
- `RelWithDebInfo`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options and the debug info.
- `MinSizeRel`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options for controlling the code size but not the debug info.

### CMAKE_C_COMPILER/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER

Usually, CMake locates and uses a C/C++ compiler installed in the host automatically. But if your compiler is not installed at the standard path, or if you want to use a different one, run the command as follows to specify the installation path of the target compiler:

```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path_to_gcc/bin/gcc> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path_to_gcc/bin/g++> ..
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path_to_clang/bin/clang> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path_to_clang/bin/clang++> ..
```

### ENABLE_CCACHE

`ENABLE_CCACHE` is `ON` by default and ccache is used to speed up the compiling of Nebula Graph.

To disable `ccache`, set `ENABLE_CCACHE` to `OFF`. On some platforms, the `ccache` installation hooks up or precedes the compiler. In such a case, you have to set an environment variable `export CCACHE_DISABLE=true` or add a line `disable=true` in `~/.ccache/ccache.conf` as well.

For more information, see the [ccache official documentation](https://ccache.dev/manual/3.7.6.html).

### NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT

`NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT` specifies the path where the third party software is installed. By default it is `/opt/vesoft/third-party`.

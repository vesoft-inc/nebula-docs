# Install Nebula Graph by compiling the source code

Installing Nebula Graph from the source code allows you to customize the compiling and installation settings and test the latest features.

## Prerequisites

* You have prepared the necessary resources described in [Prepare resources for compiling, installing, and running Nebula Graph](../1.resource-preparations.md/).

* You can access the Internet from the host you plan to install Nebula Graph.

## How to install

1. Use Git to clone the source code of Nebula Graph to your host.

    * To install the latest version of Nebula Graph 2.x, run the following command to download the source code from the `master` branch.

        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph.git
        ```

    * To install a specific version of Nebula Graph 2.x, use the `--branch <branch_name>` option to specify the correct branch. For example, to install 2.0.0 beta, run the following command.

        ```bash
        $ git clone --branch v2.0.0-beta https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph.git
        ```

2. Make the `nebula-graph` directory the current working directory.

    ```bash
    $ cd nebula-graph
    ```

3. Create a `build` directory and make it the current working directory.

    ```bash
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    ```

4. Generate the Makefile with CMake.

    > **NOTE**:
    >
    >* The installation path is `/user/local/nebula` by default. To customize it, add the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/install/path/` CMake variable in the following command.
    >* For more information about CMake variables, see [CMake variables](#cmake-variables).

   * If you are installing the latest version of Nebula Graph 2.x and has cloned the `master` branch in step 1, run the following command.

        ```bash
        $ cmake -DENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE=on -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
        ```

   * If you are installing a specific version of Nebula Graph 2.x and has cloned the corresponding branch in step 1, use the `-DNEBULA_COMMON_REPO_TAG` and `-DNEBULA_STORAGE_REPO_TAG` options to specify the correct branches of the [nebula-common](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-common "GitHub page of the nebula-common repository") and [nebula-storage](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-storage "GitHub page of the nebula-storage repository") repositories. For example, to install 2.0.0 beta, run the following command.

        ```bash
        $ cmake -DENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE=on -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        --DNEBULA_COMMON_REPO_TAG=v2.0.0-beta -DNEBULA_STORAGE_REPO_TAG=v2.0.0-beta ..
        ```

5. Compile Nebula Graph.

    Assuming *cores* is the number of CPU cores and *mem_gb* is the memory size (in GB), to appropriately speed up the compiling, you can use the value of the smaller one between cores and mem_gb/2 as the value of N in the following command.

    ```bash
    $ make -j{N}
    ```

6. Install Nebula Graph.

    ```bash
    $ make install-all
    ```

## CMake variables

Usage of CMake variables:

```bash
$ cmake -DVariable=<value> ...
```

The following CMake variables can be used at the configure (cmake) stage to adjust the compiling settings.

### ENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE

Starting from the 2.0 pre-release, Nebula Graph supports separated compute and storage. The `ENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE` variable is set to `OFF` by default so that the storage service is not installed together with the graph service.

If you are deploying Nebula Graph on a single host for testing, you can set `ENABLE_BUILD_STORAGE` to `ON` to download and install the storage service automatically.

### CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` specifies the path where the service modules, scripts, configuration files are installed. The default path is `/usr/local/nebula`.

### ENABLE_WERROR

`ENABLE_WERROR` is `ON` by default and it makes all warnings into errors. You can set it to `OFF` if needed.

### ENABLE_TESTING

`ENABLE_TESTING` is `ON` by default and unit tests are built with the Nebula Graph services. If you just need the service modules, set it to `OFF`.

### ENABLE_ASAN

`ENABLE_ASAN` is `OFF` by default and the building of ASan (AddressSanitizer), a memory error detector, is disabled. To enable it, set `ENABLE_ASAN` to `ON`. This variable is intended for Nebula Graph developers.

### CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

Nebula Graph supports the following building types:

* `Debug`, the default value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the debug info but not the optimization options.
* `Release`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options but not the debug info.
* `RelWithDebInfo`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options and the debug info.
* `MinSizeRel`, indicates building Nebula Graph with the optimization options for controlling the code size but not the debug info.

### CMAKE_C_COMPILER/CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER

Usually, CMake locates and uses a C/C++ compiler installed in the host automatically. But if your compiler is not installed at the standard path, or if you want to use a different one, run the command as follows to specify the installation path of the target compiler:

```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/gcc/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/gcc/bin/g++ ..
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang/bin/clang++ ..
```

### ENABLE_CCACHE

`ENABLE_CCACHE` is `ON` by default and ccache is used to speed up the compiling of Nebula Graph.

To disable `ccache`, set `ENABLE_CCACHE` to `OFF`. On some platforms, the `ccache` installation hooks up or precedes the compiler. In such a case, you have to set an environment variable `export CCACHE_DISABLE=true` or add a line `disable=true` in `~/.ccache/ccache.conf` as well.

For more information, see the [ccache official documentation](https://ccache.dev/manual/3.7.6.html).

### NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT

`NEBULA_THIRDPARTY_ROOT` specifies the path where the third party software is installed. By default it is `/opt/vesoft/third-party`.

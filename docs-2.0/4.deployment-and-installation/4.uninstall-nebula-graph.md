# Uninstall Nebula Graph

This topic describes how to uninstall Nebula Graph.

!!! caution

    Before re-installing Nebula Graph on a machine, follow this topic to completely uninstall the old Nebula Graph, in case the remaining data interferes with the new services.

## Prerequisites

You have stopped the Nebula Graph services. For more information, see [Manage Nebula Graph services](../2.quick-start/5.start-stop-service.md).

## Step 1: Delete data files of the Storage and Meta Services

If you have modified the `data_path` in the configuration files for the Meta Service and Storage Service, the directories where Nebula Graph stores data may not be in the installation path of Nebula Graph. Check the configuration files to confirm the data paths, and then manually delete the directories to clear all data.

For a Nebula Graph cluster, delete the data files of all Storage and Meta servers.

!!! caution

    Make sure that you have backed up all important data.

1. Find the data paths in the [Storage Service disk settings](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md#disk_configurations) and [Meta Service storage settings](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md#storage_configurations). For example:

   ```bash
   ########## Disk ##########
   # Root data path. Split by comma. e.g. --data_path=/disk1/path1/,/disk2/path2/
   # One path per Rocksdb instance.
   --data_path=/nebula/data/storage
   ```

2. Delete the directories found in step 1.

## Step 2: Delete the installation directories

The default installation path is `/usr/local/nebula`. It can be modified while installing Nebula Graph. Delete all installation directories, including the `cluster.id` files in them.

### Uninstall Nebula Graph deployed with Docker Compose

1. In the `nebula-docker-compose` directory, run the following command to stop the Nebula Graph services.

   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v

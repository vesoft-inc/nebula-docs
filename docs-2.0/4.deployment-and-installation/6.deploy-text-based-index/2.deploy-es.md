# Deploy full-text index

=== "NebulaGraph Community"

    Nebula Graph full-text indexes are powered by [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch). This means that you can use Elasticsearch full-text query language to retrieve what you want. Full-text indexes are managed through built-in procedures. They can be created only for variable `STRING` and `FIXED_STRING` properties when the listener cluster and the Elasticsearch cluster are deployed.

    ## Precaution

    Before you start using the full-text index, please make sure that you know the [restrictions](../../4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/1.text-based-index-restrictions.md).

    ## Deploy Elasticsearch cluster

    To deploy an Elasticsearch cluster, see [Kubernetes Elasticsearch deployment](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-deploy-elasticsearch.html) or [Elasticsearch installation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/targz.html). Currently only `7.x` versions of `Elasticsearch` are supported.

    !!! compatibility

        For NebulaGraph 3.4 and later versions, no additional templates need to be created.

    You can configure the Elasticsearch to meet your business needs. To customize the Elasticsearch, see [Elasticsearch Document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html).

    ## Sign in to the text search clients

    When the Elasticsearch cluster is deployed, use the `SIGN IN` statement to sign in to the Elasticsearch clients. Multiple `elastic_ip:port` pairs are separated with commas. You must use the IPs and the port number in the configuration file for the Elasticsearch.

    ### Syntax

    ```ngql
    SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (<elastic_ip:port>, {HTTP | HTTPS} [,"<username>", "<password>"]) [, (<elastic_ip:port>, ...)];
    ```

    ### Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (127.0.0.1:9200, HTTP);
    ```

    !!! Note

        Elasticsearch does not have a username or password by default. If you configured a username and password, you need to specify them in the `SIGN IN` statement.

    !!! caution

        The Elasticsearch client can only be logged in once, and if there are changes, you need to `SIGN OUT` and then `SIGN IN` again, and the client takes effect globally, and multiple graph spaces share the same Elasticsearch client.

    ## Show text search clients

    The `SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS` statement can list the text search clients.

    ### Syntax

    ```ngql
    SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS;
    ```

    ### Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS;
    +-------------+------+
    | Host        | Port |
    +-------------+------+
    | "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
    | "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
    | "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
    +-------------+------+
    ```

    ## Sign out to the text search clients

    The `SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE` statement can sign out all the text search clients.

    ### Syntax

    ```ngql
    SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE;
    ```

    ### Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE;
    ```

# Deploy full-text index

Nebula Graph full-text indexes are powered by [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch). This means that you can use Elasticsearch full-text query language to retrieve what you want. Full-text indexes are managed through built-in procedures. They can be created only for variable `STRING` and `FIXED_STRING` properties when the listener cluster and the Elasticsearch cluster are deployed.

## Precaution

Before you start using the full-text index, please make sure that you know the [restrictions](../../4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/1.text-based-index-restrictions.md).

## Deploy Elasticsearch cluster

To deploy an Elasticsearch cluster, see [Kubernetes Elasticsearch deployment](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-deploy-elasticsearch.html) or [Elasticsearch installation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/targz.html).

When the Elasticsearch cluster is started, add the template file for the Nebula Graph full-text index. For more information on index templates, see [Elasticsearch Document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-templates.html).

Take the following sample template for example:

```json
{
 "template": "nebula*",
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 3,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties" : {
            "tag_id" : { "type" : "long" },
            "column_id" : { "type" : "text" },
            "value" :{ "type" : "keyword"}
        }
  }
}
```

Make sure that you specify the following fields in strict accordance with the preceding template format:

```json
"template": "nebula*"
"tag_id" : { "type" : "long" },
"column_id" : { "type" : "text" },
"value" :{ "type" : "keyword"}
```

!!! caution

    When creating a full-text index, start the index name with `nebula`.

For example:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:9200/_template/nebula_index_template -d '
{
 "template": "nebula*",
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 3,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties" : {
            "tag_id" : { "type" : "long" },
            "column_id" : { "type" : "text" },
            "value" :{ "type" : "keyword"}
        }
  }
}'
```

You can configure the Elasticsearch to meet your business needs. To customize the Elasticsearch, see [Elasticsearch Document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html).

## Sign in to the text search clients

When the Elasticsearch cluster is deployed, use the `SIGN IN` statement to sign in to the Elasticsearch clients. Multiple `elastic_ip:port` pairs are separated with commas. You must use the IPs and the port number in the configuration file for the Elasticsearch.

### Syntax

```ngql
SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE [(<elastic_ip:port> [,<username>, <password>]), (<elastic_ip:port>), ...];
```

### Example

```ngql
nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (127.0.0.1:9200);
```

!!! Note

    Elasticsearch does not have a username or password by default. If you configured a username and password, you need to specify them in the `SIGN IN` statement.

## Show text search clients

The `SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS` statement can list the text search clients.

### Syntax

```ngql
SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS;
```

### Example

```ngql
nebula> SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS;
+-------------+------+
| Host        | Port |
+-------------+------+
| "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
| "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
| "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
+-------------+------+
```

## Sign out to the text search clients

The `SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE` statement can sign out all the text search clients.

### Syntax

```ngql
SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE;
```

### Example

```ngql
nebula> SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE;
```

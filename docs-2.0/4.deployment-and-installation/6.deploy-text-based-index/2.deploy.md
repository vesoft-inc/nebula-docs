# Deploy full-text index

Nebula Graph full-text indexes are powered by [Elasticserch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch). Full-text indexes are managed through built-in procedures. They can be created only for variable `STRING` and `FIXED_STRING` properties when the listener cluster and the elastic search cluster are ready.

## Deploy Elasticsearch cluster

To deploy an Elasticsearch cluster, see the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-deploy-elasticsearch.html).

When the Elasticsearch cluster is started, add the index template for the Nebula Graph full-text. For example:

```json
{
 "template": "nebula*",
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 3,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties" : {
            "tag_id" : { "type" : "long" },
            "column_id" : { "type" : "text" },
            "value" :{ "type" : "text"}
        }
  }
}
```

Make sure that you specify the following fields in strict accordance with the preceding template format:

```text
"template": "nebula*"
"tag_id" : { "type" : "long" },
"column_id" : { "type" : "text" },
"value" :{ "type" : "text"}
```

## Deploy full-text cluster

Full-text index data is wrote to the Elasticsearch cluster asynchronously. To use the full-text index search, you must run the full-text storage services as Listeners. Configure the `listener_path` parameter for the Listeners. For example:

```conf
########## basics ##########
# The file to host the process id
--pid_file=pids_listener/nebula-storaged.pid
```

Add the preceding configurations to the `nebula-graphd.conf` configuration file (the directory is `/usr/local/nebula/etc/` by default) for the Listeners.

## Sign in and sign out to the Elasticsearch clients

```ngql
SIGN {IN | OUT} TEXT SERVICE [(<ip:port> [,<username>, <password>]), (<ip:port>), ...]
```

When the Elasticsearch cluster is deployed, use the `SIGN IN | OUT` statement to sign in or sing out to the Elasticsearch clients. Multiple `ip:port` pairs are separated with commas. You must use the real IPs. For example:

```ngql
nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (192.168.8.1:9200);
nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (192.168.8.1:9200), (192.168.8.2:9300);
nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (192.168.8.1:9200, "user", "password");
nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (192.168.8.1:9200, "user", "password");, (127.0.0.1:9200, "user", "password");
nebula> SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE;
nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (192.168.8.1:9200, "user");
```

## Add and remove full-text Listeners

```ngql
{ADD | REMOVE} LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH (<ip:port>) [,(<ip:port>), ...]
```

When Listeners are started, use the `ADD | REMOVE LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH` statement to add or remove Listeners for a graph space. Multiple `ip:port` pairs are separated with commas. You must use the real IPs. For example:

```ngql
nebula> ADD LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH 192.168.8.210:56789;
```

## Operate Listeners

```ngql
{ADD | SHOW | DROP | LIST} LISTENER
```

Use the preceding statements to add, show, drop, and list the Listeners.

## Full-text index limitations

For now, full-text index has the following limitations:

- Full-text indexes are not deleted together with the graph space.
- Full-text indexes does not support rebuilding or altering.
- Full-text indexes does not support indexing multiple properties at one time.
- Make sure that you start the Elasticserch cluster and Nebula Graph at the same time. Or the data writing on the Elasticserch cluster can be incomplete.

# Deploy full-text index

Nebula Graph full-text indexes are powered by [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch).  This means that you can use Elasticsearch full-text query language to retrieve what you want. Full-text indexes are managed through built-in procedures. They can be created only for variable `STRING` and `FIXED_STRING` properties when the listener cluster and the Elasticsearch cluster are deployed.

## Deploy Elasticsearch cluster

To deploy an Elasticsearch cluster, see the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-deploy-elasticsearch.html).

When the Elasticsearch cluster is started, add the template file for the Nebula Graph full-text index. Take the following sample template for example:

```json
{
 "template": "nebula*",
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 3,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties" : {
            "tag_id" : { "type" : "long" },
            "column_id" : { "type" : "text" },
            "value" :{ "type" : "keyword"}
        }
  }
}
```

Make sure that you specify the following fields in strict accordance with the preceding template format:

```json
"template": "nebula*"
"tag_id" : { "type" : "long" },
"column_id" : { "type" : "text" },
"value" :{ "type" : "keyword"}
```

You can configure the Elasticsearch to meet your business needs.  To customize the Elasticsearch, see [Elasticserch Document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html).

## Deploy full-text cluster (Nebula Storage Service Raft Listener cluster)

Full-text index data is written to the Elasticsearch cluster asynchronously. To use the full-text index search, you must run one or more nebula-storaged process as the Raft Listener (short for Listener). The Listener writes the data into the Elasticsearch cluster. Configure the following parameters for the Listener. For example:

```conf
########## basics ##########
# The file to host the process id
--pid_file=pids_listener/nebula-storaged.pid
# The directory to host logging files, which must already exists
--log_dir=logs_listener

########## networking ##########
# Meta server address
--meta_server_addrs=192.168.8.5:68833
# Local ip
--local_ip=192.168.8.5
# Storage daemon listening port
--port=66780
# HTTP service ip
--ws_ip=192.168.8.5
# HTTP service port
--ws_http_port=65219
# HTTP2 service port
--ws_h2_port=65211
```

Use the real IP in the configuration file. Copy the `nebula-graphd.conf` configuration file (the directory is `/usr/local/nebula/etc/` by default) and rename it as `nebula-storaged-listener.conf`. Add the preceding configurations to the `nebula-storaged-listener.conf` configuration file.

Run the following command to start the Listener:

```bash
./bin/nebula-storaged --flagfile /path/to/your/listener/nebula-storaged-listener.conf
```

## Sign in to the text search clients

```ngql
SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE [(<elastic_ip:port> [,<username>, <password>]), (<elastic_ip:port>), ...]
```

When the Elasticsearch cluster is deployed, use the `SIGN IN | OUT` statement to sign in or sign out to the Elasticsearch clients. Multiple `elastic_ip:port` pairs are separated with commas. You must use the actual IPs and the port number in the configuration file for the Elasticsearch. For example:

```ngql
nebula> SIGN IN TEXT SERVICE (127.0.0.1:9200);
```

Elasticsearch does not have username or password by default. If you configured a username and password, you need to specify in the `SIGN IN` statement.

## Show text search clients

```ngql
SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS
```

Use the `SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS` statement to list the text search clients. For example:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW TEXT SEARCH CLIENTS;
+-------------+------+
| Host        | Port |
+-------------+------+
| "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
+-------------+------+
| "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
+-------------+------+
| "127.0.0.1" | 9200 |
+-------------+------+
```

## Sign out to the text search clients

```ngql
SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE
```

Use the `SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE` to sign out all the text search clients. For example:

```ngql
nebula> SIGN OUT TEXT SERVICE;
```

## Add full-text Listeners

```ngql
ADD LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH <listener_ip:port> [,<listener_ip:port>, ...]
```

When Listeners are started, use the `ADD LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH` statement to add the Listeners for a graph space. Multiple `listener_ip:port` pairs are separated with commas. You must use the real IPs. For example:

```ngql
nebula> ADD LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH 192.168.8.5:46780;
```

> **NOTE:** Listeners are bound to the partitions. You must add all the Listeners in one sentence or you receive an error.

## Show full-text Listeners

```ngql
SHOW LISTENER
```

Use the `SHOW LISTENER` statement to list the Listeners. For example:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW LISTENER;
+--------+-----------------+-----------------------+----------+
| PartId | Type            | Host                  | Status   |
+--------+-----------------+-----------------------+----------+
| 1      | "ELASTICSEARCH" | "[192.168.8.5:46780]" | "ONLINE" |
+--------+-----------------+-----------------------+----------+
| 2      | "ELASTICSEARCH" | "[192.168.8.5:46780]" | "ONLINE" |
+--------+-----------------+-----------------------+----------+
| 3      | "ELASTICSEARCH" | "[192.168.8.5:46780]" | "ONLINE" |
+--------+-----------------+-----------------------+----------+
```

## Remove full-text Listeners

```ngql
REMOVE LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH
```

Use the `REMOVE LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH` statement to remove all the Elasticsearch Listeners for a graph space. For example:

```ngql
nebula> REMOVE LISTENER ELASTICSEARCH;
```

When you are done with the deployment of the Elasticsearch cluster and the Listener, full-text indexes are created automatically on the Elasticsearch. You can do full-text search now. For more information, see [Full-text search](../../3.ngql-guide/14.index-statements/7.search-with-text-based-index.md).

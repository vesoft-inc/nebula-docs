After Dashboard is successfully started, you can enter `http://<ip_address>:7005` in the address bar of a browser.

If the following login interface is shown in the browser, then you have successfully deployed and started Dashboard. You can log into the GOD user of Dashboard with the default username `nebula` and password `nebula`. You can modify the password in [System Settings](../nebula-dashboard-ent/6.system-settings.md). And you also can use the GOD account to create a new account with the permission ADMIN on the [Account Management](../nebula-dashboard-ent/5.account-management.md) to log into the Dashboard.

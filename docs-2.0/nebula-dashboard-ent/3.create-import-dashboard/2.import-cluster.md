# Import clusters

This topic introduces how to import clusters using Dashboard. The current version only supports importing clusters deployed by the official DEB or RPM packages and clusters created by Dashboard. Currently, importing clusters deployed by Docker and Kubernetes is not supported.

## Steps

!!! caution

    In the same cluster, the service versions need to be unified. Importing NebulaGraph examples from different versions in the same cluster is not supported.

1. In the configuration files of each service, change the IP in `<meta|graph|storage>_server_addrs` and `local_ip` to the server's IP, and then start NebulaGraph.

  For details, see [Configurations](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) and [Manage NebulaGraph services](../../4.deployment-and-installation/manage-service.md).

2. On the **Cluster management** page, click **Import cluster**.

3. On the **Import cluster** page, enter the information of **Connect to NebulaGraph**.

  - Graphd Host: <The format of Graphd Host is the IP port of one of the Graphd processes>:n<Port>. In this example, the IP is `192.168.8.157:9669`.
  - Username: The account to connect to NebulaGraph. In this example, the username is `vesoft`.
  - Password: The password to connect to NebulaGraph. In this example, the password is `nebula`.

  !!! note

        By default, authentication is disabled in NebulaGraph. Therefore, you can use `root` as the username and any password to connect to NebulaGraph.
        When authentication is enabled in NebulaGraph, you need to use the specified username and password to connect to NebulaGraph. For details of authentication, see [NebulaGraph manual](../../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md "Click to go to NebulaGraph website").

4. On the NebulaGraph connection panel, fill in the following:

   - Enter the cluster name, 15 characters at most. In this example, the cluster name is `create_1027`, and choose whether to use `sudo` to connect to the cluster.

    !!! notice

        If your SSH account does not have permission for the NebulaGraph cluster, you can use `sudo` to connect to it.

   - **Authorize** the node. The SSH username and password of each node are required, and choose to run `sudo` or not.
   
    !!! notice

        If your SSH account has no permission to operate NebulaGraph, but can execute `sudo` commands without password, set **use sudo** to **yes**.
    
   - **Batch authorization** requires uploading the CSV file. Edit the authentication information of each node according to the downloaded CSV file. Ensure that the node information is correct, otherwise upload failure may happen.

  
   - If the node status on the page becomes **authorized**, the node authentication is successful.

4. Ensure that all nodes are authorized successfully. Click **Import cluster**.

## Next to do

After the cluster is successfully imported, you can operate the cluster. For details, see [Overview](../4.cluster-operator/1.overview.md).

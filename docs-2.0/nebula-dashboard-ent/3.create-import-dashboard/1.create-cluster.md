# Create clusters

This topic introduces how to create clusters using Dashboard.

## Steps

You can create a cluster following these steps:

1. At the top of the Dashboard page, click the **Cluster Management** button.
2. On the **Cluster management** page, click **Create cluster**.
3. On the **Create cluster** page, fill in the following:

   - Enter a **Cluster Name**, up to 15 characters for each name. In this example, the cluster name is `test`.
   - Choose a Nebula Graph version to install. In this example, the version is `Enterprise v3.1.0`.

    !!! note

        Only one Enterprise Edition of Nebula Graph is provided for you to choose from on the **Create cluster** page. To install other versions of Nebula Graph, you can download or upload the corresponding installer package on the **Package Management** page. For details, see [Package management](../11.manage-package.md).

   - Click **Upload License**.

    !!! note

        For the creation of a Community version of Nebula Graph, skip this step to upload the License file.   

   - **Add nodes**. The information of each node is required.

     1. Enter the IP information of each host. In this example, it is `192.168.8.129`.
     2. Enter the SSH information. In this example, the SSH port is `22`, the SSH user is `vesoft`, and the SSH password is `nebula`.
     3. Choose the target Nebula Graph package. In this example, the package is `nebula-graph-ent-3.1.0-ent.el7.x86_64.rpm`.
     4. Customize the cluster installation path. In this example, the default path is `.nebula/cluster`.
     5. (Optional) Enter the node name to make a note on the node. In this example, the note is `Node_1`.

   - **Import nodes in batches**. The information of each node is required. To import nodes in batches, you need to choose the installation package and click **download the CSV template**. Fill in the template and upload it. Ensure that the node is correct, otherwise, upload failure may happen.

4. Select the node and add the service you need in the upper right corner. To create a cluster, you need to add 3 types of services to the node. If not familiar with the Nebula Graph architecture, click **Auto add service**.

5. (Optional) Edit the port and HTTP port of the meta, graph, and storage services, and then click **OK**.

6. Click **Create Cluster**. Make sure the configuration is correct and there is no conflict between nodes, and then click **Confirm**.


7. If a cluster with the status of `installing` appears in the list on the cluster management page, you need to wait for 3 to 10 minutes until the status changes to `healthy`, that is, the cluster is created successfully. If the service status is `unhealthy`, it means that there is an abnormal service in the cluster, click **Detail** for more information.

## Next to do

After the cluster is successfully created, you can operate on the cluster. For details, see [Cluster operations](../4.cluster-operator/4.manage.md).

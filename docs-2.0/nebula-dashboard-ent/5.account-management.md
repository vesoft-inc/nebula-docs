# Authority management

You can log into Nebula Dashboard Enterprise Edition with different types of accounts. Different accounts have different permissions. This article introduces account types, roles, and permissions.

## Account types

Once you log into Dashboard Enterprise Edition using the initialized account name `nebula` and password `nebula`, you can create different types of accounts: LDAP accounts and general accounts. 

### LDAP accounts

Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to log into it with your enterprise account by accessing [LDAP（Lightweight Directory Access Protocol）](https://ldap.com/).

Before using an LDAP account, LDAP configurations are required.

1. In the Dashboard Enterprise Edition installation path, such as `nebula-graph-dashboard-ent/nebula-dashboard-ent/config`, find the configuration file `config.yaml`.
2. In `config.yaml`, add the following content.

  ```
  ldap:
    server: ldap://127.0.0.1 
    bindDN: cn=admin,dc=vesoft,dc=com 
    bindPassword: "" 
    baseDN: dc=vesoft,dc=com 
    userFilter: "&(objectClass=*)" 
    emailKey: mail 
  ```

  | Parameter        | Description |
  | ------------ | ---- |
  | server       | The LDAP server address.     |
  | bindDN       | The LDAP login username.    |
  | bindPassword | The LDAP login password.    |
  | baseDN       | Set the path to query user data.     |
  | userFilter   | Set a filter to LDAP search queries.    |
  | emailKey     | Set the field name used to restore email in LDAP.     |

3. Restart Dashboard Enterprise Edition to apply changes.  

After the LDAP is configured successfully, and use the initialized account name `nebula` and password `nebula` to log into Dashboard Enterprise Edition, you can create an LDAP account then. For information about how to create an account, see [Create accounts](#create_accounts).

### General accounts

All accounts are general accounts except for LDAP accounts.

## Account roles

You can set different roles for your accounts. Roles are different in permissions. There are two types of account roles in Dashboard Enterprise Edition: system roles (`admin` and `user`) and cluster roles (`owner` and `operator`).

The relationship between system roles and cluster roles and their descriptions are as follows.

**System roles**:

| Roles | Permission                                                         | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| admin  | 1. Create accounts.<br>2. Modify the role of an existing account.<br>3. Perform platform settings, system-level alert settings.<br>4. Delete accounts. | 1. There can be multiple `admin` roles, i.e. system administrators.<br/> 2. An `admin` is the `operator` of all clusters by default, i.e. an `admin` can manage all clusters. <br/>3. Displayed in the cluster member list by default. An `owner` cannot remove an `admin` unless the `admin` is converted to `user`, and the system will automatically remove the `admin` from the cluster member list. |
| user   | 1. Has read-only permissions for the system dimension. <br/>2. After an `admin` creates a new account with the `user` role, the `user` account cannot view any clusters if the corresponding cluster is not assigned to the account.  <br/>3. Can create clusters and become the `owner` of the clusters. | 1. General role. <br/>2. There can be multiple `user` roles.           |


**Cluster roles**: 

| Roles     | Permission                                                         | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operator` | 1. Scale clusters. <br/>2. Set cluster alerts. <br/>3. Manage cluster nodes.<br/>4. Manage cluster services. | 1. The cluster operator.<br/> 2. There can be multiple `operator` roles in a cluster. |
| `owner`    | 1. Have all the permissions of `operator`. <br/>2. Unbind and delete clusters.<br/>3. Add and remove accounts with `operator` roles. <br/>4. Transfer the `owner` role. | 1. The cluster owner. <br/>2. There can only be one `owner` in a cluster.    |

## Create accounts

Accounts with `admin` roles can create other accounts. The steps are as follows:

1. At the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Authority**, and click **Create**.
2. Select one method and input information to create an account, and click **OK**.

  - Invite: Set the invitee's enterprise email and role. After the invitee clicks the **Accept** button in the email to activate the account, the invitee needs to click **Login** to automatically jump to the Dashboard Enterprise Edition login page. The invitee can log into Dashboard with his/her enterprise email account and password.

    !!! note

        When selecting the **Invite** method to add accounts, ensure that the invitee's email has been added to the enterprise LDAP server.

  - Create Account: Set the login name, password, and role for the new account. For information about roles, [Account roles](#account_roles).

## View accounts

The created accounts are displayed on the **Authority** page.

- You can view the username, account type, role, associated cluster, and create time of accounts.

  - **Account Type**: Includes **platform** and **ldap**. **platform** is a general account and **ldap** is an LDAP account.
  - **Role**: Displays the role of an account, including **admin** and **user**. For more information about roles, see the above content.
  - **Associated Clusters**: Displays all the clusters that can be operated by an account. If the cluster was created by the account, the associated cluster has the `owner` tag.

- You can search for accounts in the search box, and filter accounts by selecting an associated cluster.

## Other operations

- In the **Action** column on the **Authority** page, click ![alert-edit](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/alert_edit.png) to edit account information.

- In the **Action** column on the **Authority** page, click ![alert-delete](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/alert_delete.png) to delete an account.

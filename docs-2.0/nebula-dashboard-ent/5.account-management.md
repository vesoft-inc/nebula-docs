# Platform member management

You can log into NebulaGraph Dashboard Enterprise Edition with different types of accounts. Different accounts have different permissions. This article introduces account types, roles, and permissions.

!!! note

    For managing account privileges on databases within a cluster, see [Database member](4.cluster-operator/10.database-user.md).

## Account types

Once you log into Dashboard Enterprise Edition using the initialized account name `nebula` and password `nebula`, you can create different types of accounts: general accounts and SSO accounts.

### General accounts

Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to create local accounts.

### SSO accounts

!!! note

    SSO (Single Sign On) supports LDAP, OAuth2.0 and CAS. You need to configure the related protocols before using it. For details, see [Single sign-on](system-settings/single-sign-on.md).

- LDAP accounts

  Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to log into it with your enterprise account by accessing [LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)](https://ldap.com/).

- OAuth2.0 accounts

  !!! caution

        The feature is still in beta. It will continue to be optimized.

  Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to use access_token to authorize the third-party applications to access the protected information based on [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/).

-  accounts

  Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to verify your identity based on [CAS (Central Authentication Service)](https://apereo.github.io/cas) 2.0 protocol.

## Account roles

You can set different roles for your accounts. Roles have different permissions. There are two types of account roles in Dashboard Enterprise Edition.

![roles](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/eo_dash_role_231007_en.png)

- Platform roles: `admin` and `user`.
  - The `admin` role is equivalent to the administrator of the platform, who can manage the platform roles of all accounts, and can perform daily operation and maintenance operations on all clusters.
  - The `user` role is equivalent to a general user of the platform, who can only manage the clusters that the user has created or been authorized to manage.
- Cluster roles: `owner` and `operator`.
  - The `owner` role represents the owner of a cluster, you can authorize other accounts to manage your clusters. You set yourself up as the `owner` when you create a cluster, and you can transfer the `owner` role to other accounts.
  - The `operator` role means that you can perform daily operations on the cluster, but you cannot transfer the `owner` role, change the cluster database password, unbind the cluster, and delete the cluster.

## Create accounts

Accounts with `admin` roles can create other accounts. The steps are as follows:

1. At the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Members**, and click **Add**.
2. Select one method and input information to create an account, and click **OK**.

  - Invite (LDAP or OAuth2.0 accounts): Set the invitee's account type, enterprise email, role and authorize cluster. After the invitee clicks the **Accept** button in the email to activate the account, the invitee needs to click **Login** to automatically jump to the Dashboard Enterprise Edition login page. The invitee can log into Dashboard with his/her enterprise email account and password.

  !!! note

        Automatic registration is also supported after LDAP is enabled. When you enter an unregistered account in LDAP mode on the login page, the Dashboard automatically registers the account, but the role permission is `user`.

  - Create Account (general accounts): Set the login name, password, role and authorize cluster for the new account. For information about roles, see the **Account roles** section above.

## View accounts

The created accounts are displayed on the **Authority** page.

- You can view the username, account type, role, associated cluster, and create time of accounts.

  - **Account Type**: Includes **ldap**, **oauth2.0**, **cas** and **platform**. **platform** is a general account.
  - **Role**: Displays the role of an account, including **admin** and **user**. For more information about roles, see the **Account roles** section above.
  - **Associated Clusters**: Displays all the clusters that can be operated by an account. If the cluster was created by the account, the associated cluster has the `owner` tag.

- You can search for accounts in the search box, and filter accounts by selecting an associated cluster.

## Other operations

Performing the following operations requires the account to have the associated role permissions. For details on roles, see the **Account Roles** section above.

- Edit account

  In the **Action** column, click ![alert-edit](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/alert_edit.png) to edit account information. This includes modifying the account platform role, or authorizing the `operator` role to the account for clusters where you have the `owner` role.

- Delete account

  In the **Action** column, click ![alert-delete](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/alert_delete.png) to delete an account. Accounts without the `owner` role can be deleted.

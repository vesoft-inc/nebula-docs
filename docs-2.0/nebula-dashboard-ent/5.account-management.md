# Authority management

You can log into NebulaGraph Dashboard Enterprise Edition with different types of accounts. Different accounts have different permissions. This article introduces account types, roles, and permissions.

!!! note

    You need to configure the related protocols before using LDAP accounts or OAuth2.0 accounts. For details, see [Single sign-on](system-settings/single-sign-on.md).

## Account types

Once you log into Dashboard Enterprise Edition using the initialized account name `nebula` and password `nebula`, you can create different types of accounts: LDAP accounts, OAuth2.0 accounts and general accounts.

### LDAP accounts

Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to log into it with your enterprise account by accessing [LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)](https://ldap.com/).

### OAuth2.0 accounts

!!! caution

    The feature is still in beta. It will continue to be optimized.

Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to use access_token to authorize the third-party applications to access the protected information based on [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/).

### General accounts

Dashboard Enterprise Edition enables you to create local accounts.

## Account roles

You can set different roles for your accounts. Roles are different in permissions. There are two types of account roles in Dashboard Enterprise Edition: system roles (`admin` and `user`) and cluster roles (`owner` and `operator`).

The relationship between system roles and cluster roles and their descriptions are as follows.

**System roles**:

| Roles | Permission                                                         | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| admin  | 1. Create accounts.<br>2. Modify the role of an existing account.<br>3. Perform platform settings, system-level alert settings.<br>4. Delete accounts. | 1. There can be multiple `admin` roles, i.e. system administrators.<br/> 2. An `admin` is the `operator` of all clusters by default, i.e. an `admin` can manage all clusters. <br/>3. An `admin` can assign a `user` to be the `operator` of a cluster.<br/>4. Displayed in the cluster member list by default. An `owner` cannot remove an `admin` unless the `admin` is converted to `user`, and the system will automatically remove the `admin` from the cluster member list. |
| user   | 1. Has read-only permissions for the system dimension. <br/>2. After an `admin` creates a new account with the `user` role, the `user` account cannot view any clusters if the corresponding cluster is not assigned to the account.  <br/>3. Can create clusters and become the `owner` of the clusters. | 1. General role. <br/>2. There can be multiple `user` roles.           |


**Cluster roles**: 

| Roles     | Permission                                                         | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operator` | 1. Scale clusters. <br/>2. Set cluster alerts. <br/>3. Manage cluster nodes.<br/>4. Manage cluster services. | 1. The cluster operator.<br/> 2. There can be multiple `operator` roles in a cluster. |
| `owner`    | 1. Have all the permissions of `operator`. <br/>2. Unbind and delete clusters.<br/>3. Add and remove accounts with `operator` roles. <br/>4. Transfer the `owner` role. | 1. The cluster owner. <br/>2. There can only be one `owner` in a cluster.    |

## Create accounts

Accounts with `admin` roles can create other accounts. The steps are as follows:

1. At the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Authority**, and click **Create**.
2. Select one method and input information to create an account, and click **OK**.

  - Invite (LDAP or OAuth2.0 accounts): Set the invitee's account type, enterprise email and role. After the invitee clicks the **Accept** button in the email to activate the account, the invitee needs to click **Login** to automatically jump to the Dashboard Enterprise Edition login page. The invitee can log into Dashboard with his/her enterprise email account and password.

  - Create Account (general accounts): Set the login name, password, and role for the new account. For information about roles, see the above content.

## View accounts

The created accounts are displayed on the **Authority** page.

- You can view the username, account type, role, associated cluster, and create time of accounts.

  - **Account Type**: Includes **ldap**, **oauth2.0** and **platform**. **platform** is a general account.
  - **Role**: Displays the role of an account, including **admin** and **user**. For more information about roles, see the above content.
  - **Associated Clusters**: Displays all the clusters that can be operated by an account. If the cluster was created by the account, the associated cluster has the `owner` tag.

- You can search for accounts in the search box, and filter accounts by selecting an associated cluster.

# Metrics

This topic will describe the monitoring metrics in Nebula Dashboard.

## Machine

!!! note

    - The operating system of the monitored machine is Linux by default.
    - The default unit for **Disk** and **Network** is byte. The unit changes with the data magnitude as the page displays. For example, when the flow is less than 1 KB/s, the unit is Bytes/s.
    - For all versions of Dashboard Enterprise Edition, the memory occupied by Buff and Cache will not be counted in the memory usage.

|`network_out_packets`| The number of data packages that the network card sends out per second. |

## Service

### Period

The period is the time range of counting metrics. It currently supports 5 seconds, 60 seconds, 600 seconds, and 3600 seconds, which respectively represent the last 5 seconds, the last 1 minute, the last 10 minutes, and the last 1 hour.

### Metric methods

|Parameter|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`rate`| The average rate of operations per second in a period. |
|`sum`| The sum of operations in the period. |
|`avg`| The average latency in the cycle. |
|`P75`| The 75th percentile latency. |
|`P95`| The 95th percentile latency. |
|`P99`| The 99th percentile latency. |
|`P999`| The 99.9th percentile latency. |

### Graph

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`num_queries`| The number of queries. |
|`num_slow_queries`| The number of slow queries. |
|`query_latency_us`| The average latency of queries. |
|`slow_query_latency_us`| The average latency of slow queries. |
|`num_query_errors`| The number of queries in error. |

### Meta

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`heartbeat_latency_us`| The latency of heartbeats. |
|`num_heartbeats`| The number of heartbeats. |

### Storage

|Parameter| Description|
|:---|:---|
|`add_edges_latency_us`| The average latency of adding edges. |
|`add_vertices_latency_us`| The average latency of adding vertices. |
|`delete_edges_latency_us`| The average latency of deleting edges. |
|`delete_vertices_latency_us`| The average latency of deleting vertices. |
|`get_neighbors_latency_us`| The average latency of querying neighbors. |

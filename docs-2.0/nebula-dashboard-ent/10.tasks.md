# Task Center

It takes a certain amount of time for you to make sure whether a cluster is created or scaled successfully in Nebula Dashboard Enterprise Edition. You can view the progress of such operations in Task Center. It displays the progress of ongoing operations and the history of complete operations.

The operations on clusters are defined as tasks in Task Center. Currently, there are two task types in Task Center, cluster creation and cluster scaling.

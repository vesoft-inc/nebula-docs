## Alert messages

Click **Notification**->**Alert Messages** to view alert messages.

- You can search for alert messages by message name.
- You can filter alert messages by date and time, and period. Available periods are 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days.
- You can filter alert messages by severity, type, and status. Click **Reset** to empty all filtering results.
- You can set the processing status of alert messages. The status is `unsolved` by default, and you can set the status to `Dealing` or `Solved`.

Alert messages cannot be deleted. In the `nebula-dashboard-ent/config/config.yaml` file, `messageStore` sets the number of days to keep alert messages, the value of which is 90 by default. For more information about the configuration file, see [Deploy Dashboard](2.deploy-connect-dashboard-ent.md).

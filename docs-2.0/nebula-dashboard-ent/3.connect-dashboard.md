  !!! note

        You can create LDAP, OAuth2.0, or general accounts after logging into Dashboard. For more information about the Dashboard account, see [Authority Management](5.account-management.md).

## Activate Dashboard

Before using Dashboard, it is necessary to configure License Manager (LM) to validate the effectiveness of the license and activate Dashboard.

Users can configure LM in two ways to use Dashboard:

- Configure LM directly through Dashboard:

  The dashboard currently supports visual one-click deployment of LM. After logging into Dashboard, follow the steps below to complete the deployment of LM and start using Dashboard.

  1. Click **Start** on the LM Introduction page: This page introduces the relevant concepts and overall process of LM, including installation of LM, generation of License Key, and running LM. Click **Start** to continue.

  2. Fill in the configuration information and install LM: You need to fill in the host IP, SSH-related information, installation path, License Manager port, etc. After filling in the information, click **Install LM** to install it.

  3. View LMID and generate License Key: After successfully installing LM, LMID will be generated. Users can copy LMID and [bind the LMID to generate a license key on LC](../9.about-license/2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md#bind_lmid_to_generate_a_license-key). Users need to fill in the License Key in the Dashboard interface and click **Confirm** to complete the configuration of the License.

!!! note

    If the user already has a License Key, then can click on the **Configuration LM URL** in the top right corner, enter the LM URL directly, and then click **Confirm** to complete the configuration of the License.

- Configure LM through the installation package:

  1. Install and start LM, and load the License Key in LM. For details, please refer to [License Manager](../9.about-license/2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md).

  2. In the installation path of Dashboard, go to the `etc` directory, and modify the `config.yaml` file. Set the value of `LicenseManagerURL` to the host IP and port number 9119 where LM is located, for example, `192.168.8.xxx:9119`. Users can also log into Dashboard and set the value of `LicenseManagerURL` in the License Manager Installation Guide page under **Configuration LM URL**.

# Deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition

This topic will introduce how to deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition in detail.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Dashboard Enterprise Edition, you must do a check of these:

- Select and download Dashboard Enterprise Edition of the correct version. For information about the version correspondence between Dashboard Enterprise Edition and NebulaGraph, see [Version compatibility](1.what-is-dashboard-ent.md).

- MySQL and SQLite are supported to store Dashboard metadata. To use MySQL, make sure that the environment of [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is ready and a MySQL database named as `dashboard` is create. Make sure the default character set of the database is `utf8`.

  !!! note

        No SQLite environment is required when using SQLite to store Dashboard metadata. 

- Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied.

  | Port | Description |
  | ---- | ---- |
  | 7005 | The port through which Dashboard Enterprise Edition provides the web service. |
  | 9090 | The port of the prometheus service. |
  | 9200 | The port of the nebula-stats-exporter service. |
  | 9093 | The port of the Alertmanager service, used to receive Prometheus alerts and then send them to Dashboard.|
  | 9100   | The port of the node-exporter service. The node-exporter is aumatically deployed on the target machine after a cluster is created or imported. It is used to collect the source information of machines in the cluster, including the CPU, memory, load, disk, and network.   |
  
- The [license](11.dashboard-ent-license.md) is ready.

  !!! enterpriseonly

        The license is only available in the Enterprise Edition. To obtain the license, apply for [NebulaGraph Dashboard Free Trial](https://nebula-graph.io/visualization-tools-free-trial).

## Deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition with TAR

### Installation

1. Select and download the TAR package according to your needs. It is recommended to select the latest version.

2. Use `tar -xzvf` to decompress the TAR package.

  ```bash
  tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C <install_path>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-{{dashboard_ent.release}}.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/

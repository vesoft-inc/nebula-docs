# Deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition

This topic will introduce how to deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition in detail.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Dashboard Enterprise Edition, you must do a check of these:

- Select and download Dashboard Enterprise Edition of the correct version. For information about the version correspondence between Dashboard Enterprise Edition and NebulaGraph, see [Version compatibility](1.what-is-dashboard-ent.md).

- MySQL and SQLite are supported to store Dashboard metadata. To use MySQL, make sure that the environment of [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is ready and a MySQL database named as `dashboard` is create. Make sure the default character set of the database is `utf8`.

  !!! note

        To store Dashboard metadata using SQLite, there is no need to configure the SQLite environment because SQLite is built-in to Dashboard.  

- Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied.

  | Port | Description |
  | ---- | ---- |
  | 7005 | The port through which Dashboard Enterprise Edition provides the web service. |
  | 9091 | The port of the prometheus service. |
  | 9200 | The port of the nebula-stats-exporter service. |
  | 9093 | The port of the Alertmanager service, used to receive Prometheus alerts and then send them to Dashboard.|
  | 9100   | The port of the node-exporter service. The node-exporter is automatically deployed on the target machine after a cluster is created or imported. It is used to collect the source information of machines in the cluster, including the CPU, memory, load, disk, and network.   |

## Deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition with TAR

### Installation

1. Select and download the TAR package according to your needs. It is recommended to select the latest version.


2. Use `tar -xzvf` to decompress the TAR package.

  ```bash
  tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C <install_path>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-{{dashboard_ent.release}}.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/
  ```

3. Enter the extracted folder and modify the `config.yaml` file in the `etc` directory to set the `LicenseManagerURL` parameter to the host IP and port number `9119` where the License Manager ([LM](../9.about-license/2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md)) is located and to set the relevant configuration.

## Manage services in Dashboard

The following section presents two methods for managing the Dashboard service. It's important to note that these methods are not interchangeable. For instance, you can't start the service using the `dashboard.service` script and then use the `systemctl` command to stop it.

- You can use the `dashboard.service` script to start, restart, stop, and check the Dashboard services.

  ```bash
  sudo <dashboard_path>/scripts/dashboard.service
  [-v] [-h] [-version]
  <start|restart|stop|status>  <prometheus|webserver|exporter|gateway|all>
  ```

  | Parameter                  | Description       |
  | :------------------------- | :------------------- |
  | `dashboard_path` | Dashboard installation path.  |
  | `-v`                       | Display detailed debugging information.   |
  | `-h`                       | Display help information.        |
  | `-version`                 | Display the Dashboard version.        |
  | `start`                    | Start the target services.       |
  | `restart`                  | Restart the target services.       |
  | `stop`                     | Stop the target services.           |
  | `status`                   | Check the status of the target services.       |
  | `prometheus`               | Set the prometheus Service as the target service. |
  | `webserver`                | Set the webserver Service as the target service.  |
  | `exporter`                 | Set the exporter Service as the target service.   |
  | `gateway`                  | Set the gateway Service as the target service.    |
  | `all`                      | Set all the Dashboard services as the target services.       |

  For example, if Dashboard is installed in the current directory, you can manage its services using the following commands:

  ```bash
  sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service start all # Start Dashboard. 
  sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service stop all # Stop Dashboard. 
  sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service status all # Check Dashboard status.
  sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service restart all # Restart Dashboard.
  ```

- If you installed Dashboard using RPM or DEB packages, you can manage the service using systemd. You can start, view, restart and stop the service using the `systemctl` command.

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start nebula-dashboard.target # Start all service.
  sudo systemctl status nebula-dashboard.target # Check Dashboard status.
  sudo systemctl restart <nbd-prometheus.service|nbd-alert-manager.service|nbd-stats-exporter.service|nbd-webserver.service> # Restart service respectively.
  sudo systemctl stop <nbd-prometheus.service|nbd-alert-manager.service|nbd-stats-exporter.service|nbd-webserver.service> # Stop service respectively.
  ```
  
  For example, to stop the Prometheus service, run the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop nbd-prometheus.service
  ```

## View logs

- Users who manage services using `dashboard.service` can view the Dashboard Enterprise Edition logs in the `logs` directory.

  For example:

  ```
  cat logs/prometheus.log
  ```

  The descriptions of the log files are as follows.

  |Log file| Description |
  |:--|:--|
  |`alertmanager.log`| Alertmanager service log.   |
  |`nebula-stats-exporter.log`| nebula-stats-exporter service log.    |
  |`prometheus.log`|  Prometheus service log.   |
  |`br`| Backup and restore service log.    |
  |`webserver.log`| Dashboard service log. </br>It takes effect only when the `Log.Mode` in the Dashboard configuration is `console`.   |
  |`access.log`| Access log. </br>It takes effect only when the `Log.Mode` in the Dashboard configuration is `file`.   |
  |`error.log`|  Error log. </br>It takes effect only when the `Log.Mode` in the Dashboard configuration is `file`. |
  |`severe.log`| Severe log. </br>It takes effect only when the `Log.Mode` in the Dashboard configuration is `file`.   |
  |`slow.log`|  Slow log. </br>It takes effect only when the `Log.Mode` in the Dashboard configuration is `file`.  |
  |`stat.log`|  Statistic log. </br>It takes effect only when the `Log.Mode` in the Dashboard configuration is `file`.  |

- Users managing services with systemd can access the logs for each Dashboard Enterprise Edition service through `journalctl`.

  ```bash
  journalctl -u {nbd-prometheus.service|nbd-alert-manager.service|nbd-stats-exporter.service|nbd-webserver.service} -b
  ```

  For example, to view the logs of the Prometheus service:

  ```bash
  journalctl -u nbd-prometheus.service -b
  ```

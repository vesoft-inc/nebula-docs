# Deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition

This topic will introduce how to deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition in detail.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Dashboard Enterprise Edition, you must do a check of these:

- Select and download Dashboard Enterprise Edition of the correct version. For information about the version correspondence between Dashboard Enterprise Edition and Nebula Graph, see [Version compatibility](1.what-is-dashboard-ent.md).

- The environment of [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is ready and a MySQL database named as `dashboard` is create. Make sure the default character set of the database is `utf8`.
- Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied.

  | Port | Description |
  | ---- | ---- |
  | 7005 | The port through which Dashboard Enterprise Edition provides the web service. |
  | 9090 | The port of the prometheus service. |
  | 9200 | The port of the nebula-stats-exporter service. |
  | 9093 | The port of the Alertmanager service, used to receive Prometheus alerts and then send them to Dashboard.|
  | 9100   | The port of the node-exporter service. The node-exporter is aumatically deployed on the target machine after a cluster is created or imported. It is used to collect the source information of machines in the cluster, including the CPU, memory, load, disk, and network.   |
  
- The license is ready.

  !!! enterpriseonly

        The license is only available in the Enterprise Edition. To obtain the license, apply for [Nebula Dashboard Free Trial](https://forms.gle/AxVejqKjWT9Z8HLq8).

## Deploy Dashboard Enterprise Edition with TAR

### Installation

1. Select and download the TAR package according to your needs. It is recommended to select the latest version.

To purchase, contact our sales team via email (inquiry@vesoft.com). For features of Dashboard Enterprise Edition, see [Pricing](https://nebula-graph.com.cn/pricing/).

2. Use `tar -xzvf` to decompress the TAR package.

  ```bash
  tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C <install_path>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-{{dashboard_ent.release}}.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/
  ```

3. Edit `vim /usr/local/nebula-dashboard-ent/config/config.yaml` to modify the configuration.

  ```bash

4. Copy the license file to the `nebula-dashboard-ent` directory.

  ```bash
  cp -r <license> <dashboard_path>
  ```

  For example:

  ```bash
  cp -r nebula.license /usr/local/nebula-dashboard-ent
  ```

5. Start Dashboard.

  You can use the following command to start the Dashboard with one click.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/local/nebula-dashboard-ent/scripts
  sudo ./dashboard.service start all
  ```

  Or execute the following commands to start prometheus, webserver, exporter and gateway services to start Dashboard.

  ```bash
  cd scripts
  sudo ./dashboard.service start prometheus # Start prometheus service
  sudo ./dashboard.service start webserver # Start webserver service
  sudo ./dashboard.service start exporter # Start exporter service
  sudo ./dashboard.service start gateway # Start gateway service
  ```

!!! note

    If you change the configuration file after starting Dashboard, you can run `dashboard.service restart all` in the `scripts` directory to synchronize the changes to the Dashboard client page.

### Manage Dashboard Service

You can use the `dashboard.service` script to start, stop, and check the Dashboard services.

```bash
sudo <dashboard_path>/dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service
[-v] [-h]
<start|stop|status>  <prometheus|webserver|exporter|gateway|all>

        You can [apply online](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeALEyndeE9btlcI1VMbfDewyWMuPxwglPsYvcYOlfx245KJA/viewform) for Dashboard Enterprise Edition free trial. To purchase, contact our sales team via email (inquiry@vesoft.com). For features of Dashboard Enterprise Edition, see [Pricing](https://nebula-graph.com.cn/pricing/).


2. Run `sudo rpm -i <rpm>` to install the RPM package.

  For example, run the following command to install Dashboard Enterprise Edition. Installation path is `/usr/local/nebula-dashboard-ent` by default.

  ```bash
  sudo rpm -i nebula-dashboard-ent-<version>.x86_64.rpm
  ```

  You can also run the following command to specify the installation path.

  ```bash
  sudo rpm -i nebula-dashboard-ent-xxx.rpm --prefix=<path> 
  ```

  During the installation process, you need to enter the path to the license and MySQL-related information, including the IP and port to connect to MySQL, the account and password to log into MySQL, and the MySQL database name.

  For example:

  ```
  Nebula Dashboard Enterprise version need license, please enter the license file path(~/nebula.license): /home/vesoft/nebula.license  # The path to the license.
  
  Do you want to start the service now?[Y/N]: y
  Step1: set mysql database config
  Enter mysql host(127.0.0.1): 192.168.8.157  # The IP address of the connected MySQL database.

  ```


4. (Optional) To configure recipients of cluster alert notifications and to configure LDAP accounts, run `vim /usr/local/nebula-dashboard-ent/config/config.yaml` and add the following settings.

  ```
  # Information of the sender's Email used to invite LDAP accounts.
  mail:
    host: smtp.office365.com #  The SMTP server address.

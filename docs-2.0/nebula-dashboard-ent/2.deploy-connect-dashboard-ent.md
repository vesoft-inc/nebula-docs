  | 7005 | The port through which Dashboard provides the web service. |
  | 8090 | The port of the nebula-http-gateway service. |
  | 9090 | The port of the prometheus service. |

        For features of Dashboard Enterprise Edition, see [Pricing](https://nebula-graph.com.cn/pricing/).

2. Use `tar -xzvf` to decompress the tar package.

   ```bash
   $ tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   $ tar -xzvf nebula-dashboard-ent-1.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
   ```

3. Edit `vim config/config.yaml` to modify the configuration.

   ```bash

     host: 192.168.8.157 # The IP address of the connected MySql database
     port: 3306 # The port of the connected MySql database
     username: root # The username to log in MySql
     password: nebula # The password to log in MySql
     name: dashboard # The name of the corresponding database
     autoMigrate: true # Auto database tables creation, the default value of which is true
   # Information about the exporter port

     nebulaPort: 9200 # The port of the nebula-stats-exporter service
   # Information of services
   proxy:
     gateway:
       target: "127.0.0.1:8090" # The IP address and port of the gateway service
     prometheus:
       target: "127.0.0.1:9090" # The IP address and port of the prometheus service
   ```

4. Copy the license file to the `nebula-dashboard-ent` directory.

   ```bash
   $ cp -r <license> <dashboard_path>
   ```

   For example:
 
   ```bash
   $ cp -r nebula.license /usr/local/nebula-dashboard-ent
   ```

5. Start Dashboard.

   You can use the following command to start the Dashboard with one click.

   ```bash
   $ cd scripts
   $ sudo ./dashboard.service start all
   ```

   Or execute the following commands to start prometheus, webserver, exporter and gateway services to start Dashboard.

   ```bash
   $ cd scripts
   $ sudo ./dashboard.service start prometheus # Start prometheus service
   $ sudo ./dashboard.service start webserver # Start webserver service
   $ sudo ./dashboard.service start exporter # Start exporter service
   $ sudo ./dashboard.service start gateway # Start gateway service
   ```

## Manage Dashboard Service

You can use the `dashboard.service` script to start, stop, and check the Dashboard services.

```bash
$ sudo <dashboard_path>/dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service

### Examples

Dashboard is installed in the current directory, and you can use the following commands to manage services.

```bash
$ sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service start all #start all Dashboard service 
$ sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service stop all #stop all Dashboard service 
$ sudo /dashboard/scripts/dashboard.service status all #check all Dashboard service 
```

## Next to do

After Dashboard is successfully started, you can enter `http://<ip_address>:7005` in the address bar of a browser.

If the following login interface is shown in the browser, then you have successfully deployed and started Dashboard. You can log into Dashboard as a GOD user with the default username `nebula` and password `nebula`. You can modify the password in [System Settings](../nebula-dashboard-ent/6.system-settings.md). And you also can use the GOD account to create a new account with the permission ADMIN on the [Account Management](../nebula-dashboard-ent/5.account-management.md) to log into the Dashboard.

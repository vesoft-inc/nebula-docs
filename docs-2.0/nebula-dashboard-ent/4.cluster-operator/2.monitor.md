# Cluster monitoring

This section introduces the monitoring function of the Dashboard, including default monitoring and custom monitoring.

At the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Cluster Management**, and click **Detail** at the right of the target cluster. **Monitoring** at the left navigation bar contains default monitoring and custom monitoring.

## Default monitoring

The default cluster monitoring page of Dashboard displays 8 monitoring metric panels, which cannot be modified or deleted. Users can add, modify, and delete monitoring metric panels in a new dashboard using the **Custom Monitoring** function described below.

The 8 default monitoring metrics displayed are:

- CPU Utilization: Percentage of CPU usage.
- Memory Utilization: Percentage of memory usage.
- Disk Usage: Disk usage shows instances, disk name, mount point, and usage.
- Load 5: System average load over the last 5 minutes.
- QPS: Queries per second.
- Num Queries & Slow Queries: Number of queries and slow queries.
- Num Opened Sessions: Number of active sessions.
- Add Edge Latency & Add Vertex Latency: Delay time for adding edges and vertices.

Clicking the ![watch](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/watch.png) button on the upper right corner of each panel can filter the time and view each monitoring metric on a separate subpage.

- **Panel Name**: Custom panel name.

- **Panel Type**: Includes **Node Linear Panel**, **Service Linear Panel**, and **Disk Usage Bar Panel**. Different panel types determine the available metrics for selection.

- **Metric**: Select different metrics based on the panel type. For example, for **Node Linear Panel**, you can select CPU, Memory, Load, Disk, Network In/Out, etc. Multiple metrics can be selected. Please refer to the [Metrics](../7.monitor-parameter.md) for more details.

- **Metric Type**: Choose from percentage, byte, byte/s, io/s, number, etc.

- **Show Index**: Panel display order, with numbers ranging from 1 to infinity, with smaller numbers being displayed first. The panels are sorted by the creation time by default.

!!! note

    The Graph service supports a set of graph space-based monitoring metrics. When selecting Graph service-related metrics, you can select the corresponding graph space in the added **spaces** dropdown list.

!!! Caution

    Before using Graph Space Metrics, users need to set `enable_space_level_metrics` to `true` in the Graph service. For specific operations, see [Update config](operator/config-management.md).

### Managing Monitoring

To manage monitoring metric panels, click the ![setup](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/Setup_cn.png) button in the upper right corner of each panel to modify or delete the panel.

You can also click the ![watch](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/watch.png) button in the upper right corner of the panel to enter the subpage of the monitoring metrics panel and view the monitoring metrics.

## More operations

The section above the page is used for monitoring filtering, with the following features:

- Time selection: By default, 6 hours of monitoring data is selected for viewing. You can select a time based on a specific date, or choose a recent period, such as the past 5 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, or 3 days.

- Instance selection: Monitoring data for all nodes is displayed by default, and you can adjust the selections within the **Instance** box.

- Service selection: Monitoring data for all services is displayed by default, and you can adjust the selections within the **Service** box.

- Data update: The monitoring data on the page is not automatically updated by default (i.e., it is turned `Off`).

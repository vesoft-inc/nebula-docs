# Cluster operation

This topic introduces the cluster operation of Dashboard, including cluster node, cluster service, cluster scaling, service configuration, member management and version upgrade.


## Node

On this page, the information of all nodes will be shown, including the cluster name, Host(SSH_User), CPU (Core), etc.

- To add a node quickly, click **Add Node** and enter the following information, the Host, SSH port, SSH user, SSH password, and select a NebulaGraph package.

- Click the ![plus](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/Plus.png) button to view the process name, service type, status, runtime directory of the corresponding node.

  - Click **Node Monitoring** to jump to the detailed node monitoring page. For more information, see [Cluster monitoring](../4.cluster-operator/2.monitor.md).

  - Click **Service Management** to jump to the service management page.

  - Click **Edit Node** to modify the SSH port, SSH user, and SSH password.
  
  - If a node has no service, you can **Delete Node**.

## Scale

!!! enterpriseonly 

    Only when the cluster you created or imported is the Enterprise Edition, this feature is available.

- On this page, you can **add node** and **import node in batches** quickly, and add **Graph services** and **Storage services** to the existing nodes.

- Click the **Reset** button to restore to the initial state.

!!! caution

    - Currently, you can dynamically scale Storaged and Graphd services through Dashboard. The Metad service cannot be scaled. When scaling a cluster, it is recommended to back up data in advance so that data can be rolled back when scaling fails. For more information, see [FAQ](../../20.appendix/0.FAQ.md).

    - Make sure that services of the same type are not deployed on the same node, and at least one of each type of services is deployed in the cluster.

In this example, storage services with nodes `192.168.8.143` and `192.168.8.167` are added, and Graph services with node `192.168.8.169` are deleted. If the box is dotted and the service name is greyed, it means the service is removed. If the box is solid, it means the service is newly added.

In the **Services** section below, green indicates services that will be added soon, and red indicates services that will be removed. You can modify the port, HTTP port, and HTTP2 port of the newly added service.

## Service

- On this page, you can select the service type, service status, and host to filter the shown data, quickly select one or multiple services, and start/stop/restart the service with one click.

- Click the ![nav](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/nav-dashboard.png) icon to quickly view the [Service monitoring](../4.cluster-operator/2.monitor.md).

!!! danger

    If you click **Stop**/**Restart**, the running task will be stopped instantly, which may cause data inconsistency. It is recommended to perform this operation during the low peak period of the business.

## Update Config

On this page, you can modify configuration files of Storage and Graph services. For more information, see [Storage service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md) and [Graph service configuration](../../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/3.graph-config.md). Updating configuration files is a batch operation, and each Storage/Graph configuration file will be modified.

- After clicking **Save**, the configuration will take effect after the next service restart.

- Click **Save and Restart** to directly restart the service to make the configuration take effect immediately.

  !!! danger

        If you click **Save and Restart**, the running task will be stopped and the cluster will be restarted instantly, which may cause data inconsistency. It is recommended to perform this operation during the low peak period of the business.

## Member Management

Accounts with the role `admin` and cluster creators with the role `user` can add members to manage clusters. By default, the role of cluster creators is `owner`, and is displayed on the **Member Management** page. The role of added members is `operator`.

For more information about accounts and roles, see [Authority management](../5.account-management.md).

### Add cluster members

The accounts of cluster members must be included in Dashboard accounts. For information about how to create an account, see [Authority management](../5.account-management.md).

You can follow the below steps to add cluster members.

1. At the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Cluster Management**.
2. On the right side of the target cluster, click **Detail**.
3. On the left-side navigation bar of the page, click **Operation**->**Member Management**.
4. On the **Member Management** page, click the search box at the top left.
5. In the drop-down list, select the target account that you want to add to be the administrator of the cluster, and then click **Add**.

### Other operations

- At the top right of the **Member Management** page, you can search for cluster members.
- Click ![delete](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/alert_delete.png) to delete members.

## Version Upgrade

NebulaGraphDashboard Enterprise Edition supports upgrading the version of the existing NebulaGraph cluster.

!!! caution

    - During the upgrade, the cluster will replace binary files. The upgrade speed is fast, but the cluster will still be stopped and restarted.
    - Automatic rollback is not supported. Users can manually upgrade the cluster again when the upgrade failed.
    - The upgrade cannot be stopped or cancelled.

!!! note

    - Only supports upgrading the NebulaGraph cluster that version greater than **3.0.0**.
    - Do not supports upgrading cluster across major version.
    - The community edition can be upgraded to the enterprise edition by uploading and verifying licenses, and the enterprise edition can be upgraded to the community edition.
    - The cluster can be upgraded to a minor version in the current major version, including a smaller version than the current minor version.

1. At the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Cluster Management**.
2. On the right side of the target cluster, click **Detail**.
3. On the left-side navigation bar of the page, click **Operation**->**Version Upgrade**.
4. On the **Version Upgrade** page, confirm **Current NebulaGraph version**, select the upgrade version and then click **Next**.

  !!! note

        If you do not find the suitable version, click **Package Management** to download or upload the required version installation package. For details, see [Package management](../11.manage-package.md).

5. Perform the upgrade check, and then click **Next**.
   The cluster will be shut down during the upgrade and automatically restart the services after the upgrade. You can use the **diagnostics report** to help you judge whether the timing to upgrade is suitable.

6. Confirm the upgrade information again, including **Cluster Name**, **Current NebulaGraph Version** and **Upgrade NebulaGraph Version**, then click **Upgrade**.
   Users can view the upgrade task information in [task center](../10.tasks.md), the task type is `version update`.

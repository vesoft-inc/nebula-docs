# Cluster Diagnositics

The cluster diagnostics feature in Dashboard Enterprise Edition is to locate and analyze the current cluster problems within a specified time range and summarize the diagnostic results and cluster monitoring information to web-based diagnostic reports.

## Features

- Diagnostic reports allow you to troubleshoot the current cluster problems within a specified time range.
- Quickly understand the basic information of the nodes, services, service configurations, and query sessions in the cluster.
- Based on the diagnostic reports, you can make operation and maintenance recommendations and cluster alerts.


## Entry

1. In the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Cluster Management**.
2. On the right side of the target cluster, click **Detail**.
3. In the left navigation bar, click **Information**->**Cluster Diagnostics**.

## Create diagnostic reports


1. Select a time range for diagnostics. You can customize the time range or set the range by selecting time intervals, including `1 Hour`, `6 Hours`, `12 Hours`, `1 Day`, `3 Days`, `7 Days`, and `14 Days`.

  !!! caution

        Note that the end time of the diagnostic range you set cannot be longer than the current time. If the end time is longer than the current time, the end time will be set to the current time.

2. On the **Cluster Diagnostics** page, click **Start**.

3. Wait for the diagnostic report to be generated. When the diagnostic status is changed to **success** from **generating**, the diagnostic report is ready. 


## View diagnostic reports

In the diagnostic report list, you can view the diagnostic reports by clicking **Detail** on the right side of the target report.

A diagnostic report contains the following information:

- Diagnosis Result
- Basic Info
- Load Info

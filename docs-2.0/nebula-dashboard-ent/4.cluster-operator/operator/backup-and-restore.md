# Back up and restore NebulaGraph data

To prevent data loss due to operational errors or system failures, NebulaGraph offers the Backup & Restore (BR) tool to help users back up and restore graph data. Dashboard Enterprise Edition integrates BR capabilities and offers simple UIs that allow users to perform data backup and restore operations in just a few steps. This document describes how to use Dashboard Enterprise Edition to back up and restore NebulaGraph data.


## Limits

- Currently, Dashboard only supports backup data to cloud storage services compatible with the S3 protocol (e.g. OSS, MinIO, Ceph RGW, etc.) and does not support local backups.

  !!! note

        To back up data to a local device, see [What is Backup & Restore](../../../backup-and-restore/nebula-br-ent/1.br-ent-overview.md).

- Backup and restoration of space-level data are not supported.
- Backup data can only be restored to the original cluster, and cannot be restored across clusters.
- Breakpoint moving of backup and restore data is not supported.
- Currently, only the logs generated by backup and restore operations are supported.

## Prerequisites

- [A cluster is created with Dashboard](../../3.create-import-dashboard/1.create-cluster.md).
- A cloud storage service that is compatible with the S3 protocol is activated and a storage bucket is created. For details, see the documentation for the corresponding cloud storage service.
  
## Steps

### Entry

1. In the top navigation bar, click **Cluster Management**.
2. On the right side of the target cluster, click **Detail**. 
3. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation**->**Backup&Restore**.

### Full backup

#### Backup to cloud storage compatible with S3

Data is backed up to the cloud storage service by creating a backup file as follows.

1. On the **Backup&Restore** page, click the **Backup List** tab. 
2. In the upper right corner of the page, click **S3 Service Settings**. 
3. Fill in the configuration information for the corresponding cloud storage service and click **Submit**.
   
  | Parameter        | Description                                                       |
  | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | s3.access_key | The Access Key ID that is used to identify a user. For example, `AKIAI44QH8DHBxxxx`.          |
  | s3.endpoint   | The domain URL of the entry point for the cloud storage service. For example, `https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`. The URL containing `bucket_name` is not supported, such as `https://{bucket_name}.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`. |
  | s3.region     | The physical location of a data center. For example, `us-east-1`.                    |
  | s3.secret_key | The Access Key Secret that is used to verify the identity of the user. For example, `je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCoxxxx`. |
  | storage path  | The data storage path which **must start with `s3`**. For example, `s3://br-test/backup/`.                 |      

  The following configurations are examples for Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service and Amazon S3:

  !!! caution

        To back up data to OSS, you need to replace `oss` with `s3` for the OSS storage path. For example, change the original OSS path `oss://nebula-br-test/` to `s3://nebula-br-test/`.
  
4. In the upper right corner of the page, click **Create New Backup**.
5. On the **Create New Backup** page, choose **Full backup**.
6. Click **Environment check** to check whether the relevant configurations are working properly, and then click **Submit**.

  Environment check includes:

  - The NebulaGraph services are running.
  - The cluster must have at least one space.
  - The access key to log onto the storage service has not expired.
  - The status of business traffic. It only checks if the QPS of your business is 0. When QPS is not 0, you are prompted to back up data during off-peak hours.

  !!! note

        You are unable to submit the backup when your cluster works abnormally or the access key to the storage service has expired.
  
7. View the created backup file in the backup list.

  !!! note

        You are unable to perform a new backup until the previous backup is completed. 

8. Check if the created backup file exists in the storage service.
  Successfully created backup files are stored to the storage path set above, like `s3://nebula-br-test`.

  - Amazon S3:
  ![br_s3_path](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/br_s3_2022-06-20_12-07-37.png)

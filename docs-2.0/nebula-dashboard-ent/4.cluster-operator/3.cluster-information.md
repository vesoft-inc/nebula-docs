On the **Overview Info** page, you can see the information of the Nebula Graph cluster, including Storage leader distribution, Storage service details, versions and hosts information of each Nebula Graph service, and partition distribution and details.

## Storage Leader Distribution

In this section, the number of Leaders and the Leader distribution will be shown.

- Click the **Balance Leader** button in the upper right corner to distribute Leaders evenly and quickly in the Nebula Graph cluster. For details about the Leader, see [Storage Service](../../1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/4.storage-service.md).

- Click **Detail** in the upper right corner to view the details of the Leader distribution.


### Version

In this section, the version and host information of each Nebula Graph service will be shown. Click **Detail** in the upper right corner to view the details of the version and host information.


## Service information

In this section, the information on Storage services will be shown. The parameter description is as follows:

<!-- balance-3.1
You can click the **Balance Date** button in the upper right corner to start the task to distribute all partitions in the cluster evenly.

## Partition Distribution

Select the specified graph space in the upper left corner, and then you can perform the following operations:

- View the distribution of partitions in the specified graph space. You can see the IP addresses and ports of all Storage services in the cluster, and the number of partitions in each Storage service.
- Click **Balance Data** to evenly distribute the partitions in the specified graph space.
- Click **Balance Data Remove** to migrate the partitions in the specified Storage service and distribute them evenly to the other Storage services in the cluster. The system will guide you to select the host IP where the specified Storage service is located.

Click **Detail** in the upper right corner to view more details.


## Partition information

|`Leader`|The IP address and port of the leader.|
|`Peers`|The IP addresses and ports of all the replicas.|
|`Losts`|The IP addresses and ports of faulty replicas.|

Click **Detail** in the upper right corner to view details. You can also enter the partition ID into the input box in the upper right corner of the details page to filter the shown data. 

<!-- ## Long-term task


On this page, the information of all jobs will be shown. Before viewing the job information, you need to select a graph space in the upper left corner. Online managing jobs is not supported.

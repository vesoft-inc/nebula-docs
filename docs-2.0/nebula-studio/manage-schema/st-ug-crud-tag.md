# Operate tags

After a graph space is created in NebulaGraph, you can create tags. With Studio, you can use the **Console** page or the **Schema** page to create, retrieve, update, or delete tags. This topic introduces how to use the **Schema** page to operate tags in a graph space only.

## Prerequisites

To operate a tag on the **Schema** page of Studio, you must do a check of these:

- Studio is connected to NebulaGraph.
- A graph space is created.
- Your account has the authority of GOD, ADMIN, or DBA.

## Create a tag

1. In the toolbar, click the **Schema** tab.

2. In the **Graph Space List** page, find a graph space and then click its name or click **Schema** in the **Operations** column.

3. In the **Current Graph Space** field, confirm the name of the graph space. If necessary, you can choose another name to change the graph space.

4. Click the **Tag** tab and click the **+ Create** button.

5. On the **Create** page, do these settings:

  - **Name**: Specify an appropriate name for the tag. In this example, `course` is specified.

  - **Comment** (Optional): Enter the description for tag.

  - **Define Properties** (Optional): If necessary, click **+ Add Property** to do these settings:

    - Enter a property name.

    - Select a data type.

    - Select whether to allow null values..
    
    - (Optional) Enter the default value.

    - (Optional) Enter the description.

    - **Set TTL (Time To Live)** (Optional): If no index is set for the tag, you can set the TTL configuration: In the upper left corner of the **Set TTL** panel, click the check box to expand the panel, and configure `TTL_COL` and `TTL_ DURATION` (in seconds). For more information about both parameters, see [TTL configuration](../../3.ngql-guide/8.clauses-and-options/ttl-options.md "Click to go to NebulaGraph website").

6. When the preceding settings are completed, in the **Equivalent to the following nGQL statement** panel, you can see the nGQL statement equivalent to these settings.

# Operate tags

After a graph space is created in Nebula Graph, you can create tags. With Studio, you can use the **Console** page or the **Schema** page to create, retrieve, update, or delete tags. This article only introduces how to use the **Schema** page to operate tags in a graph space.

## Studio version

Studio of v{{ studio.release}} or later versions supports this function. For more information, see [check updates](../about-studio/st-ug-check-updates.md).

## Prerequisites

To operate a tag on the **Schema** page of Studio, you must do a check of these:

- Studio is connected to Nebula Graph.
- A graph space is created.
- Your account has the authority of GOD, ADMIN, or DBA.

## Create a tag

To create a tag on the **Schema** page, follow these steps:

1. In the toolbar, click the **Schema** tab.

2. In the **Graph Space List** page, find a graph space, and then click its name or the button ![Icon of setting](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-018.png "Settings") in the **Operations** column.

3. In the **Current Graph Space** field, confirm the name of the graph space. If necessary, you can choose another name to change the graph space.

4. Click the **Tag** tab and click the **+ Create** button.

5. On the **Create** page, do these settings:

   a. **Name**: Specify an appropriate name for the tag. In this example, `course` is specified.

   b. (Optional) If necessary, in the upper left corner of the **Define Properties** panel, click the check box to expand the panel and do these settings:

      - To define a property: Enter a property name, a data type, and a default value.

      - To add multiple properties: Click the **Add Property** button and define more properties.

      - To cancel a defined property: Besides the **Defaults** column, click the button ![Icon of deletion](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-020.png "Cancel").

   c. (Optional) If no index is set for the tag, you can set the TTL configuration: In the upper left corner of the **Set TTL** panel, click the check box to expand the panel and configure `TTL_COL` and `TTL_ DURATION`. For more information about both parameters, see [TTL configuration](../../3.ngql-guide/8.clauses-and-options/ttl-options.md "Click to go to Nebula Graph website").

6. When the preceding settings are completed, in the **Equivalent to the following nGQL statement** panel, you can see the nGQL statement equivalent to these settings.

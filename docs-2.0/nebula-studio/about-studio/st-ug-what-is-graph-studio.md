# What is Nebula Graph Studio

Nebula Graph Studio (Studio in short) is a browser-based visualization tool to manage Nebula Graph. It provides you with a graphical user interface to manipulate graph schemas, import data, explore graph data, and run nGQL statements to retrieve data. With Studio, you can quickly become a graph exploration expert from scratch.

## Release distributions

For now, Studio v2.x has only Docker-based distribution. You can deploy Studio v2.x with Docker and connect it to Nebula Graph v2.x. For more information, see [Deploy Studio](../install-configure/st-ug-deploy.md).

Studio on Cloud is not available now.

## Features

Studio provides these features:

- Graphical **Console** enables you to run nGQL statements and read the results in a human-friendly way.

- The **Explore** function enables you to explore the graph data. It helps you dig the relationships among data and improves the efficiency of data analysis.

## Scenarios

You can use Studio v2.x in one of these scenarios:

- You have a dataset, and you want to explore and analyze data in a visualized way. You can use Docker Compose or Nebula Graph Cloud Service to deploy Nebula Graph and then use Studio to explore or analyze data in a visualized way.  

- You have deployed Nebula Graph and imported a dataset. You want to use a GUI to run nGQL statements or explore and analyze graph data in a visualized way.  

- You are a beginner of nGQL (Nebula Graph Query Language) and you prefer to use a GUI rather than a command-line interface (CLI) to learn the language.

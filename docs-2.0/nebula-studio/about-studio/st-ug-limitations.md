- Only CSV files without headers are supported, and only commas are separators separator.
- Each file of a maximum of 100 MB is supported.
- A total amount of a maximum of 1 GB is supported for each Nebula graph instance.

Only CSV files without headers can be uploaded, but no limitations are applied to the size and store period for a single file. The maximum data volume depends on the storage capacity of your machine.

## nGQL statements

On the **Console** page of Docker-based and RPM-based Studio v3.x, all the nGQL syntaxes except these are supported:

- `USE <space_name>`: You cannot run such a statement on the **Console** page to choose a graph space. As an alternative, you can click a graph space name in the drop-down list of **Current Graph Space**.
- You cannot use line breaks (\\). As an alternative, you can use the Enter key to split a line.

<!--
For Studio on Cloud, besides the preceding syntax, you cannot run these account and role management statements on the Console page:

- `CREATE USER`
- `ALTER USER`
- `CHANGE PASSWORD`

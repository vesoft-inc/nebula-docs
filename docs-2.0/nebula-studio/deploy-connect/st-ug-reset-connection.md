## Clear connection
<!--
On NebulaGraph Cloud Service, users cannot clear the connection.
-->
If you want to reset NebulaGraph, you can clear the connection and reconfigure the database.

When the Studio is still connected to a NebulaGraph database, you can choose **setting > clear connect** at the toolbar. If the **Config Server** page is displayed on the browser, it means that Studio has successfully disconnected from the NebulaGraph database.

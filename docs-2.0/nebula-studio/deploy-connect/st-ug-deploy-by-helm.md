# Deploy Studio with Helm

This topic describes how to deploy Studio with Helm.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Studio, you need to install the following software and ensure the correct version of the software:

| Software                                                     | Requirement  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)                          | \>= 1.14  |
| [Helm](https://helm.sh)                                      | \>= 3.2.0 |

## Install

1. Use Git to clone the source code of Studio to the host.

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-studio.git
   ```

2. Make the `nebula-studio` directory the current working directory.
   
   ```bash
    $ cd nebula-studio
    ```

3. Assume using release name:`my-studio`, installed Studio in Helm Chart.
    
    ```bash
    $ helm upgrade --install my-studio --set service.type=NodePort --set service.port=30070 deployment/helm
    ```

4. When Studio is started, use `http://address-of-node:30070/` to get access to Studio.

   If you can see the **Config Server** page on the browser, Studio is started successfully.

   ![The Config Server page shows that Studio is started successfully](../figs/st-ug-025.png "Studio is started")


## Uninstall

```bash
 $ helm uninstall my-studio
```

## Next to do

On the **Config Server** page, connect Docker-based Studio to Nebula Graph. For more information, see [Connect to Nebula Graph](st-ug-connect.md).

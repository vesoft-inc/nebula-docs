# Create a schema

To batch import data into Nebula Graph, you must have a graph schema. You can create a schema on the **Console** page or on the **Schema** page of Studio.

> **NOTE**: You can use nebula-console to create a schema. For more information, see [Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose
](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/2.0/2.quick-start/3.connect-to-nebula-graph/) and [Get started with Nebula Graph](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/2.0/2.quick-start/4.nebula-graph-crud/).

## Prerequisites

To create a graph schema on Studio v2.x, you must do a check of these:

- Studio is connected to Nebula Graph v2.x.

- Your account has the privilege of GOD, ADMIN, or DBA.

- The schema is designed.

- A graph space is created.
  > **NOTE**: If no graph space exists and your account has the GOD privilege, you can create a graph space on the **Console** page. For more information, see [CREATE SPACE](../../3.ngql-guide/9.space-statements/1.create-space.md). In this example, we recommend that you set `vid_type=FIXED_STRING(100)` in the `CREATE SPACE` statement.

## Create a schema with Schema

To create a schema on the **Schema** page, follow these steps:

1. Create tags. For more information, see [Operate tags](../manage-schema/st-ug-crud-tag.md).

2. Create edge types. For more information, see [Operate edge types](../manage-schema/st-ug-crud-edge-type.md).

## Create a schema with Console

To create a schema on the **Console** page, follow these steps:

1. In the toolbar, click the **Console** tab.

2. In the **Current Graph Space** field, choose a graph space name. In this example, **mooc_actions** is used.

   ![Choose a graph space name for the Current Graph Space field](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-031.png "Choose a graph space")

3. In the input box, enter these statements one by one and click the button ![Icon of Run](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-008.png "Run").

   ```nGQL
   // To create a tag named "user", with no property
   nebula> CREATE TAG user ();
   
   // To create a tag named "course", with one property
   nebula> CREATE TAG course (courseId int);

   // To create an edge type named "action", with seven properties
   nebula> CREATE EDGE action (actionId int, duration double, label bool, feature0 double, feature1 double, feature2 double, feature3 double);
   ```

If the preceding statements are executed successfully, the schema is created. You can run the statements as follows to view the schema.

```nGQL
// To list all the tags in the current graph space
nebula> SHOW TAGS;

// To list all the edge types in the current graph space
nebula> SHOW EDGES;

// To view the definition of the tags and edge types
nebula> DESCRIBE TAG user;
nebula> DESCRIBE TAG course;
nebula> DESCRIBE EDGE action;
```

If the schema is created successfully, in the result window, you can see the definition of the tags and edge types.

## Next to do

When a schema is created, you can [import data](st-ug-import-data.md).

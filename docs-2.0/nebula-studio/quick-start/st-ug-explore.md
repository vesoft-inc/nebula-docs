# Query graph data

When data is imported, you can use the **Console** page or the **Explore** page to query graph data.

For example, if you want to query the properties of the course named _History of Chinese Women Through Time_, you can perform these optional operations:

* On the **Console** tab: Run `FETCH PROP ON * "History of Chinese Women Through Time";`. The result window shows all the property information of this vertex. When the result returns, click the **Open in Explore** button and then you can view the vertex information in a visualized way.

# Backup and restore data with snapshots

Nebula Graph supports using snapshots to backup and restore data.

## Authentication and snapshots

Nebula Graph [authentication](1.authentication/1.authentication.md) is disabled by default. In this case, All users can use the snapshot feature.

If authentication is enabled, only the GOD-role user can use the snapshot function. For more information about roles, see [Roles and privileges](1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

## Precautions

* To prevent data loss, create a snapshot as soon as the system structure changes, for example, after operations such as `ADD HOST`, `DROP HOST`, `CREATE SPACE`, `DROP SPACE`, and `BALANCE` are performed.
* Nebula Graph cannot automatically delete the invalid files created by a failed snapshot task, you have to manually delete them by using [`DROP SNAPSHOT`](#delete_a_snapshot).
* Customizing the storage path for the snapshots is not supported for now.

## Snapshot form and path

Nebula Graph snapshots are in the form of directories with names like `SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12`. The suffix `2021_03_09_08_43_12` is generated automatically based on the creation time.

When a snapshot is created, snapshot directories will be automatically created in the `checkpoints` directory on the leader Meta server and each Storage server.

To fast locate the path where the snapshots are stored, you can use the Linux command `find`. For example:

```bash
$ find |grep 'SNAPSHOT_2021_03_11_07_30_36'
./data/meta2/nebula/0/checkpoints/SNAPSHOT_2021_03_11_07_30_36
./data/meta2/nebula/0/checkpoints/SNAPSHOT_2021_03_11_07_30_36/data
./data/meta2/nebula/0/checkpoints/SNAPSHOT_2021_03_11_07_30_36/data/000081.sst
...
```

!!! note

    For how to get the snapshot name, see [View snapshots](#view_snapshots).

## Create a snapshot

Run `CREATE SNAPSHOT` to create a snapshot for all the graph spaces based on the current time for Nebula Graph.

!!! note

    Creating a snapshot for a specific graph space is not supported yet.

If the creation fails, [delete the snapshot](#delete_a_snapshot) and try again. If it still fails, go to the [Nebula Graph community](https://discuss.nebula-graph.io/) for help.

## View snapshots

To view all existing snapshots, run `SHOW SNAPSHOTS`.

```ngql
nebula> SHOW SNAPSHOTS;
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| Name                           | Status  | Hosts            |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| "SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12" | "VALID" | "127.0.0.1:9779" |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| "SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52" | "VALID" | "127.0.0.1:9779" |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
```

The parameters in the return information are described as follows.

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
|`Name`|Name of the snapshot directory.|
|`Status`|Status of the snapshot. `VALID` indicates that the creation succeeded and `INVALID` indicates that it failed.|
|`Hosts`|IP addresses and ports of all Storage servers at the time the snapshot was created.|

## Delete a snapshot

To delete a snapshot, use the following syntax:

```ngql
DROP SNAPSHOT <snapshot_name>;
```

Example:

```ngql
nebula> DROP SNAPSHOT SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12;
nebula> SHOW SNAPSHOTS;
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| Name                           | Status  | Hosts            |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| "SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52" | "VALID" | "127.0.0.1:9779" |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
```

## Restore data with a snapshot

1. [Find the snapshot directories](#snapshot_form_and_path) you want to use for data restoration.

2. Choose an approach to restore the data files:
   * Change the `data_path` in the [Meta configuration](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md) and [Storage configuration](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md) to the snapshot path.
   * Copy the snapshot directories to other locations, and change the `data_path` to these locations.
   * Copy all the content in the snapshot directories into the directories where the `checkpoints` directories are located, and cover the existing files that have duplicate names with them. For example, cover `/usr/local/nebula/data/meta/nebula/0/data` with `/usr/local/nebula/data/meta/nebula/0/checkpoints/SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52/data`.

3. [Restart Nebula Graph](../2.quick-start/5.start-stop-service.md).

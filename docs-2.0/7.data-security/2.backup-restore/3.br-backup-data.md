# Use BR to back up data

After the BR is compiled, you can back up data of the entire graph space. This topic introduces how to use the BR to back up data.

## Prerequisites

To back up data with the BR, do a check of these:

- The BR is compiled. For more information, see [Compile BR](2.compile-br.md).

- The Nebula Graph services are running.

- The [nebula-agent](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-agent) has been downloaded and the nebula-agent service is running on each host in the cluster.

- If you store the backup files locally, create a directory with the same absolute path on the meta servers, the storage servers, and the BR machine for the backup files and get the absolute path. Make sure the account has write privileges for this directory.

  !!! note

      In the production environment, we recommend that you mount Network File System (NFS) storage to the meta servers, the storage servers, and the BR machine for local backup, or use Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS for remote backup. When you restore the data from local files, you must manually move these backup files to a specified directory, which causes redundant data and troubles. For more information, see [Restore data from backup files](4.br-restore-data.md).

## Procedure

Run the following command to perform a full backup for the entire cluster.

!!! Note

    Make sure that the local path where the backup file is stored exists.

```bash
$ ./bin/br backup full --meta <ip_address> --storage <storage_path>
```

For example: 

- Run the following command to perform a full backup for the entire cluster whose meta service address is `127.0.0.1:9559`, and save the backup file to `/home/nebula/backup/`.

  !!! caution

        If there are multiple metad addresses, you can use any one of them.

  ```bash
  $ ./bin/br backup full --meta "127.0.0.1:9559" --storage "local:///home/nebula/backup/"
  ```

- Run the following command to perform a full backup for the entire cluster whose meta service address is `127.0.0.1:9559`, and save the backup file to `backup` in the `br-test` bucket of the object storage service compatible with S3 protocol.

  ```bash
  $ ./bin/br backup full --meta "127.0.0.1:9559" --s3.endpoint "http://127.0.0.1:9000" --storage="s3://br-test/backup/" --s3.access_key=minioadmin --s3.secret_key=minioadmin --s3.region=default
  ```

The parameters are as follows.

| Parameter |  Data type | Required | Default values | Description |
|:--        |:--         |:--       |:--             |:--          |
| `-h,-help`  | -          | No       | None           | View help information. |
| `--debug`   | string     | No       | None           | View more log information. |
| `--log`     | string     | No       | `"br.log"`     | Specify the path of the log of br. |
| `--meta`    | string     | Yes      | None           | Specify the address and port number of the meta service. |
| `--spaces`  | stringArray| No       | None           | Specify which space graphs to backup. If not specified, br will backup all space graphs (experimental). |
| `--storage` | string     | Yes      | None           | Specify the storage location of backup data, format: `<Schema>://<PATH>` <br>Schema: Optional values are `local` and `s3`. When set to `s3`, you need to set `s3.access_key`, `s3.endpoint`, `s3.region` and `s3.secret_key`. <br>PATH: The storage location of backup data. |
| `--s3.access_key` | string  | No  | None  | Set the access key id.  |
| `--s3.endpoint` | string  | No  | None  | Set the S3 endpoint URL, please specify the http or https scheme explicitly.  |
| `--s3.region` | string  | No  | None  | Set the region or location to upload or download backup files.  |
| `--s3.secret_key` | string  | No  | None  | Set the secret key for access id.  |

## Next to do

After the backup files are generated, you can use the BR to restore them for Nebula Graph. For more information, see [Use BR to restore data](4.br-restore-data.md).

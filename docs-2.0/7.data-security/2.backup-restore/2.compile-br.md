# Compile BR

For now, the BR is not provided as a package. You can compile the BR.

> **NOTE**: If you want to store the backup files locally, we recommend that you compile the BR on one meta server of the target Nebula Graph cluster where you will perform data restoration. For more information, see [Restore data from backup files](4.br-restore-data.md).

## Prerequisites

To compile the BR, do a check of these:

- [Go](https://github.com/golang/go "Click to go to GitHub") 1.14 or a later version is installed.
- make is installed.

## Procedure

To compile the BR, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `nebula-storage` repository to your machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-storage.git
   ```

2. Change to the `br` diretory.

   ```bash
   cd nebula-storage/util/br
   ```

3. Compile the BR.

   ```bash
   make build && make test
   ```

When the BR is compiled successfully, you can find the `br` binary file under the `nebula-storage/util/br/bin/` directory.

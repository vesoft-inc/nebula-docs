# Authentication

Nebula Graph replies on local authentication or LDAP authentication to implement access control.

Nebula Graph creates a session when a client connects to it. The session stores information about the connection, including the user information. If the authentication system is enabled, the session will be mapped to corresponding users.

!!! Note

    By default, the authentication is disabled and Nebula Graph allows connections with the username `root` and any password.

Nebula Graph supports local authentication and LDAP authentication.

## Local authentication

Local authentication indicates that usernames and passwords are stored locally on the server, with the passwords encrypted. Users will be authenticated when trying to visit Nebula Graph.

### Enable local authentication

1. Modify the `nebula-graphd.conf` file (`/usr/local/nebula/etc/` is the default path), set `--enable_authorize=true` and save the modification.

2. Restart the Nebula Graph services. For how to restart, see [Manage Nebula Graph services](../../2.quick-start/5.start-stop-service.md).

!!! note

    You can use the username `root` and password `nebula` to log into Nebula Graph after enabling local authentication. This account has the build-in God role. For more information about roles, see [Roles and privileges](3.role-list.md).

## LDAP authentication

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a lightweight client-server protocol for accessing directories and building a centralized account management system. LDAP authentication and local authentication can be enabled at the same time, but LDAP authentication has a higher priority. If the local authentication server and the LDAP server both have the information of user `Amber`, Nebula Graph reads from the LDAP server first.

### Enable LDAP authentication

!!! Enterpriseonly

    LDAP authentication is an Enterprise-only feature. For how to enable LDAP, see Authenticate with an LDAP server (TODO: doc).

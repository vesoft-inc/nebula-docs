# Authentication

Nebula Graph replies on local authentication or LDAP authentication to implement access control.

Nebula Graph creates a session when a client connects to it. The session stores information about the connection, including the user information.

By default, authentication is disabled and Nebula Graph allows connections with the username `root` and any password. If the authentication system is enabled, Nebula Graph checks a session according to the authentication configuration, and decides whether the session should be allowed or denied.

## Local authentication

Local authentication indicates that usernames and passwords are stored locally on the server, with the passwords encrypted.

### Enable local authentication

1. In the `/usr/local/nebula/etc/nebula-graphd.conf` file, set `--enable_authorize=true` and save the modification.

  !!! note

        `/usr/local/nebula/` is the default installation path for Nebula Graph. If you have changed it, use the actual path.

2. Restart the Nebula Graph services. For how to restart, see [Manage Nebula Graph services](../../2.quick-start/5.start-stop-service.md).

!!! note

    You can use the username `root` and password `nebula` to log into Nebula Graph after enabling local authentication. This account has the build-in God role. For more information about roles, see [Roles and privileges](3.role-list.md).

## LDAP authentication

!!! Enterpriseonly

    LDAP authentication is an Enterprise-only feature. For how to enable LDAP, see Authenticate with an LDAP server (TODO: doc).

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), is a lightweight client-server protocol for accessing directories and building a centralized account management system.

LDAP authentication and local authentication can be enabled at the same time, but LDAP authentication has a higher priority. If the local authentication server and the LDAP server both have the information of user `Amber`, Nebula Graph reads from the LDAP server first.

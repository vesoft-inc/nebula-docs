# User management

This topic describes how to manage users and roles.

By default, Nebula Graph allows connections with the username `root` and any password. After [enabling authentication](1.authentication.md), only valid users can connect to Nebula Graph and access the resources according to the [user roles](3.role-list.md).

Once the role of a user is modified, the user has to re-login to make the new role takes effect.

## CREATE USER

The `root` user with the GOD role can run `CREATE USER` to create a new user.

* Syntax

    ```ngql
    CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] <user_name> [WITH PASSWORD '<password>'];
    ```

* Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'nebula';
    ```

## GRANT ROLE

Users with the GOD role or the ADMIN role can run `GRANT ROLE` to assign a built-in role in a graph space to a user. For more information about Nebula Graph built-in roles, see [Roles and privileges](3.role-list.md)

!!! note

    If the target user is connected to Nebula Graph when running `GRANT ROLE`, the new role takes effect when the user logs out and logs in again.

* Syntax

    ```ngql
    GRANT ROLE <role_type> ON <space_name> TO <user_name>;
    ```

* Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> GRANT ROLE USER ON basketballplayer TO user1;
    ```

## SHOW ROLES

Run `SHOW ROLES` to list the roles in a graph space.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  SHOW ROLES IN <space_name>;
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> SHOW ROLES IN basketballplayer;
  +---------+-----------+
  | Account | Role Type |
  +---------+-----------+
  | "user1" | "ADMIN"   |
  +---------+-----------+
  ```

## REVOKE ROLE

Users with the GOD role or the ADMIN role can run `REVOKE ROLE` to revoke a user's role in a graph space.

!!! note

    If the target user is connected to Nebula Graph when running `REVOKE ROLE`, the old role still takes effect until the user logs out.

* Syntax

    ```ngql
    REVOKE ROLE <role_type> ON <space_name> FROM <user_name>;
    ```

* Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> REVOKE ROLE USER ON basketballplayer FROM user1;
    ```

## CHANGE PASSWORD

With the correct username and password, users can run `CHANGE PASSWORD` to set a new password for a user.

* Syntax

    ```ngql
    CHANGE PASSWORD <user_name> FROM '<old_password>' TO '<new_password>';
    ```

* Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> CHANGE PASSWORD user1 FROM 'nebula' TO 'nebula123';
    ```

## ALTER USER

The `root` user with the GOD role can run `ALTER USER` to set a new password for a user.

* Syntax

    ```ngql
    ALTER USER <user_name> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

* Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> ALTER USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'nebula';
    ```

## DROP USER

The `root` user with the GOD role can run `DROP USER` to remove a user.

!!! note

    Removing a user does not close the user's current session, and the user role still takes effect in the session until the session is closed.

* Syntax

    ```ngql
    DROP USER [IF EXISTS] <user_name>;
    ```

* Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> DROP USER user1;
    ```

## SHOW USERS

The `root` user with the GOD role can run `SHOW USERS` to list all the users.

* Syntax

    ```ngql
    SHOW USERS;
    ```

* Example

    ```ngql
    nebula> SHOW USERS;
    +-----------+
    | Account   |
    +-----------+
    | "test1"   |
    +-----------+
    | "test2"   |
    +-----------+
    | "test3"   |
    +-----------+
    ```

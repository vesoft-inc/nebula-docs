# User management

User management is an indispensable part of Nebula Graph access control. This topic describes how to manage users and roles.

After [enabling authentication](1.authentication.md), only valid users can connect to Nebula Graph and access the resources according to the [user roles](3.role-list.md).

!!! Note

    * By default, the authentication is disabled. Nebula Graph allows connections with the username `root` and any password.
    * Once the role of a user is modified, the user has to re-login to make the new role takes effect.


## CREATE USER

The `root` user with the **GOD** role can run `CREATE USER` to create a new user.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] <user_name> [WITH PASSWORD '<password>'];
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'nebula';
  ```

## GRANT ROLE

Users with the **GOD** role or the **ADMIN** role can run `GRANT ROLE` to assign a built-in role in a graph space to a user. For more information about Nebula Graph built-in roles, see [Roles and privileges](3.role-list.md).

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  GRANT ROLE <role_type> ON <space_name> TO <user_name>;
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> GRANT ROLE USER ON basketballplayer TO user1;
  ```

## REVOKE ROLE

Users with the **GOD** role or the **ADMIN** role can run `REVOKE ROLE` to revoke the built-in role of a user in a graph space. For more information about Nebula Graph built-in roles, see [Roles and privileges](3.role-list.md).

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  REVOKE ROLE <role_type> ON <space_name> FROM <user_name>;
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> REVOKE ROLE USER ON basketballplayer FROM user1;
  ```

## DESCRIBE USER

Users can run `DESCRIBE USER` to list the roles for a specified user.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  DESCRIBE USER <user_name>;
  DESC USER <user_name>;
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> DESCRIBE USER user1;
  +---------+--------------------+
  | role    | space              |
  +---------+--------------------+
  | "ADMIN" | "basketballplayer" |
  +---------+--------------------+
  ```

## SHOW ROLES

Users can run `SHOW ROLES` to list the roles in a graph space.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  SHOW ROLES IN <space_name>;
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> SHOW ROLES IN basketballplayer;
  +---------+-----------+
  | Account | Role Type |
  +---------+-----------+
  | "user1" | "ADMIN"   |
  +---------+-----------+
  ```

## CHANGE PASSWORD

Users can run `CHANGE PASSWORD` to set a new password for a user. The old password is needed when setting a new one.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  CHANGE PASSWORD <user_name> FROM '<old_password>' TO '<new_password>';
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> CHANGE PASSWORD user1 FROM 'nebula' TO 'nebula123';
  ```

## ALTER USER

The `root` user with the **GOD** role can run `ALTER USER` to set a new password for a user. The old password is not needed when setting a new one.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  ALTER USER <user_name> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> ALTER USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'nebula';
  ```

## DROP USER

The `root` user with the **GOD** role can run `DROP USER` to remove a user.

!!! note

    Removing a user does not close the current session of the user, and the user role still takes effect in the session until the session is closed.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  DROP USER [IF EXISTS] <user_name>;
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> DROP USER user1;
  ```

## SHOW USERS

The `root` user with the **GOD** role can run `SHOW USERS` to list all the users.

* Syntax

  ```ngql
  SHOW USERS;
  ```

* Example

  ```ngql
  nebula> SHOW USERS;
  +-----------+
  | Account   |
  +-----------+
  | "test1"   |
  | "test2"   |
  | "test3"   |
  +-----------+
  ```

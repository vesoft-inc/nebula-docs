# Roles and privileges

A role is a collection of privileges. You can assign a role to a user for access control.

## Built-in roles

Nebula Graph does not support custom roles, but it has multiple built-in roles:

* GOD
  * GOD is the original role with all privileges not limited to graph spaces. It is similar to `root` in Linux and `administrator` in Windows.
  * When the Meta Service is initialized, the one and only GOD role user `root` is automatically created with the password `nebula`.
  > **CAUTION:** Modify the password for `root` as soon as possible for security.
  * The default username `root` is immutable.

* ADMIN
  * An ADMIN role can read and write both the Schema and the data in a specific graph space.
  * An ADMIN role of a graph space can grant DBA, USER, and GUEST roles in the graph space to other users.

* DBA
  * A DBA role can read and write both the Schema and the data in a specific graph space.
  * A DBA role of a graph space CANNOT grant roles to other users.

* USER
  * A USER role can read and write data in a specific graph space.
  * The Schema information is read-only to the USER roles in a graph space.

* GUEST
  * A GUEST role can only read the Schema and the data in a specific graph space.

> **NOTE:** A user can have only one role in a graph space.

> * Only the GOD role can run `SHOW USERS` and `SHOW SNAPSHOTS`.

# Storage Service configurations

Nebula Graph provides two initial configuration files for the Storage Service, `nebula-storaged.conf.default` and `nebula-storaged.conf.production`. Users can use them in different scenarios conveniently. The default file path is `/usr/local/nebula/etc/`.

!!! caution

    * It is not recommended to modify the value of `local_config` to `false`. If modified, the Nebula Graph service will first read the cached configurations, which may cause configuration inconsistencies between clusters and cause unknown risks.
    * It is not recommended to modify the configurations that are not introduced in this topic, unless you are familiar with the source code and fully understand the function of configurations.

## How to use the configuration files

To use the initial configuration file, choose one of the above two files and delete the suffix `.default` or `.production` from the initial configuration file for the Meta Service to apply the configurations defined in it.

## About parameter values

If a parameter is not set in the configuration file, Nebula Graph uses the default value. Not all parameters are predefined. And the predefined parameters in the two initial configuration files are different. This topic uses the parameters in `nebula-metad.conf.default`.

!!! Note

    The configurations of the Raft Listener and the Storage service are different. For details, see [Deploy Raft listener](../../4.deployment-and-installation/6.deploy-text-based-index/3.deploy-listener.md).

For all parameters and their current values, see [Configurations](1.configurations.md).

## Basics configurations

| Name         | Predefined value                   | Description              |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :------------------|
| `daemonize`  | `true`                   | When set to `true`, the process is a daemon process. |
| `pid_file`   | `pids/nebula-storaged.pid` | The file that records the process ID. |
| `timezone_name` | - | Specifies the Nebula Graph time zone. This parameter is not predefined in the initial configuration files. The system default value is `UTC+00:00:00`. For the format of the parameter value, see [Specifying the Time Zone with TZ](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html "Click to view the timezone-related content in the GNU C Library manual"). For example， `--timezone_name=CST-8` represents the GMT+8 time zone. |
| `local_config` | `true` | When set to `true`, the process gets configurations from the configuration files. |

!!! note

    * While inserting property values of [time types](../../3.ngql-guide/3.data-types/4.date-and-time.md), Nebula Graph transforms them to a UTC time according to the time zone specified by `timezone_name`. The time-type values returned by nGQL queries are all UTC time.
    * `timezone_name` is only used to transform the data stored in Nebula Graph. Other time-related data of the Nebula Graph processes still uses the default time zone of the host, such as the log printing time.

## Logging configurations

| Name           | Predefined value                    | Description                |
| :------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `log_dir`     | `logs` | The directory that stores the Meta Service log. It is recommended to put logs on a different hard disk from the data. |
| `minloglevel` | `0` | Specifies the minimum level of the log. That is, no logs below this level will be printed. Optional values are `0` (INFO), `1` (WARNING), `2` (ERROR), `3` (FATAL). It is recommended to set it to `0` during debugging and `1` in a production environment. If it is set to `4`, Nebula Graph will not print any logs. |
| `v`           | `0` | Specifies the detailed level of the log. The larger the value, the more detailed the log is. Optional values are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`. |
| `logbufsecs`  | `0` | Specifies the maximum time to buffer the logs. If there is a timeout, it will output the buffered log to the log file. `0` means real-time output. This configuration is measured in seconds. |
|`redirect_stdout` | `true` | When set to `true`, the process redirects the`stdout` and `stderr` to separate output files. |
|`stdout_log_file`  |`graphd-stdout.log`     | Specifies the filename for the `stdout` log.                           |
|`stderr_log_file`  |`graphd-stderr.log`     | Specifies the filename for the `stderr` log.                           |
|`stderrthreshold`  | `2`                    | Specifies the `minloglevel` to be copied to the `stderr` log.          |

## Networking configurations

| Name                       | Predefined value | Description          |
| :----------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `meta_server_addrs`        | `127.0.0.1:9559` | Specifies the IP addresses and ports of all Meta Services.  Multiple addresses are separated with commas. |
|`local_ip`                  | `127.0.0.1`      | Specifies the local IP for the Storage Service. The local IP address is used to identify the nebula-storaged process. If it is a distributed cluster or requires remote access, modify it to the corresponding address.|
| `port`                     | `9779`           | Specifies RPC daemon listening port of the Storage service. The external port for the Meta Service is predefined to `9779`. The internal port is predefined to `9777`, `9778`, and `9780`. Nebula Graph uses the internal port for multi-replica interactions. |
| `ws_ip`                    | `0.0.0.0`        | Specifies the IP address for the HTTP service. |
| `ws_http_port`             | `19779`          | Specifies the port for the HTTP service. |
| `ws_h2_port`               | `19780`          | Specifies the port for the HTTP2 service. |
|`heartbeat_interval_secs`   | `10`             | Specifies the default heartbeat interval. Make sure the `heartbeat_interval_secs` values for all services are the same, otherwise Nebula Graph **CANNOT** work normally. This configuration is measured in seconds. |

!!! caution

    The real IP address must be used in the configuration file. Otherwise, `127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0` cannot be parsed correctly in some cases.

## Raft configurations

| `raft_rpc_timeout_ms`          | `500`            | Specifies the time to expire the Raft RPC. The configuration is measured in milliseconds. |
| `wal_ttl`                      | `14400`          | Specifies the lifetime of the RAFT WAL. The configuration is measured in seconds. |

| `data_path`                      | `data/storage` | Specifies the data storage path. Multiple paths are separated with commas. One RocksDB example corresponds to one path. |
| `minimum_reserved_bytes`         | `268435456` | Specifies the minimum remaining space of each data storage path. When the value is lower than this standard, the cluster data writing may fail. This configuration is measured in bytes. The default value is `1073741824`, namely, 1GB. |
| `rocksdb_batch_size`             | `4096` | Specifies the block cache for a batch operation. The configuration is measured in bytes. |
| `rocksdb_block_cache`            | `4` | Specifies the block cache for BlockBasedTable. The configuration is measured in megabytes.|
| `engine_type`                    | `rocksdb` | Specifies the engine type. |
| `rocksdb_compression`            | `lz4` | Specifies the compression algorithm for RocksDB. Optional values are `no`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `lz4hc`, `zlib`, `bzip2`, and `zstd`. |

| `enable_partitioned_index_filter` | - | When set to `true`, it reduces the amount of memory used by the bloom filter. But in some random-seek situations, it may reduce the read performance. |

## RocksDB options

## For super-Large vertices

When the query starting from each vertex gets an edge, truncate it directly to avoid too many neighboring edges on the super-large vertex, because a single query occupies too much hard disk and memory. Or you can truncate a certain number of edges specified in the `Max_edge_returned_per_vertex` parameter. Excess edges will not be returned. This parameter applies to all spaces.

| Property name                   | Default value                    | Description  |
| :------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| max_edge_returned_per_vertex | 2147483647 | Specifies the maximum number of edges returned for each dense vertex. Excess edges are truncated and not returned. This parameter is not predefined in the configuration files. |

!!! compatibility

    The reservoir sampling algorithm in Nebula Graph 1.x is no longer supported in Nebula Graph {{ nebula.release }}.

## Storage configurations for large dataset

When you have a large dataset (in the RocksDB directory) and your memory is tight, we suggest that you set the `enable_partitioned_index_filter` parameter to `true`. The performance is affected because RocksDB indexes are cached.

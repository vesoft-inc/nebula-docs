# Kernel configurations

This document gives some introductions to the Kernel configurations in Nebula Graph.

## ulimit

### ulimit -c

`ulimit -c` limits the size of the core dumps. We recommend that you set it to `unlimited`. The command is:

```bash
ulimit -c unlimited
```

### ulimit -n

`ulimit -n` limits the number of open files. We recommend that you set it to more than 100,000. For example:

```bash
ulimit -n 130000
```

## Memory

### vm.swappiness

`vm.swappiness` is the percentage of the free memory before starting swap. The greater the value, the more likely the swap occurs. We recommend that you set it to 0. When set to 0, the page cache is removed first. Note that when `vm.swappiness` is 0, it does not mean that there is no swap.

### vm.min_free_kbytes

`vm.min_free_kbytes` is used to force the Linux VM to keep a minimum number of kilobytes free. If you have a large system memory, we recommend that you increase this value. For example, if your physical memory 128GB, set it to 5GB. If the value is not big enough, the system cannot apply for enough continuous physical memory.

### vm.max_map_count

`vm.max_map_count` limits the maximum number of vma (virtual memory area) for a process. The default value is `65530`. It is enough for most applications. If your memory application fails because the memory consumption is large, increase the `vm.max_map_count` value.

### vm.overcommit_memory

`vm.overcommit_memory` contains a flag that enables memory overcommitment. We recommend that you set the default value 0 or 1. DO NOT set it to 2.

### vm.dirty_*

These values control the aggressiveness of the dirty page cache for the system. For write-intensive scenarios, you can make adjustments based on your needs (throughput priority or delay priority). We recommend that you use the system default value.

### Transparent huge page

For better delay performance, you must delete the transparent huge pages (THP). The options are  `/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` and`/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag`. For example:

```bash
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
swapoff -a && swapon -a
```

## Networking

### net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle

The default value for this parameter is `1`. If set, the congestion window is timed out after an idle period. We recommend that you set it to 0, especially for long fat links (high latency and large bandwidth).

### net.core.somaxconn

`net.core.somaxconn` is the maximum number of the backlogged sockets. The default value is `128`. For scenarios with a large number of burst connections, we recommend that you set it to greater than `1024`.

### net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog

The maximum number of remembered connection requests. The setting rule for this parameter is the same as that of `net.core.somaxconn`.

### net.core.netdev_max_backlog

It determines the maximum number of packets. We recommend that you increase it to greater than 10,000, especially for 10G network adapters. The default value is `1000`.

### net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_*

Keep alive parameters for the TCP connections. For applications that use a 4-layer transparent load balancer, if the idle connection is disconnected unexpectedly, decrease `tcp_keepalive_time` and `tcp_keepalive_intvl`.

### net.ipv4.tcp_rmem/wmem

The minimum, default, and maximum size of the TCP socket receive buffer. For long fat links, we recommend that you increase the default value to bandwidth * RTT.

### scheduler

For SSD devices, we recommend that you set `/sys/block/DEV_NAME/queue/scheduler` to noop or none.

## Other parameters

### kernel.core_pattern

we recommend that you set it to core and set `kernel.core_uses_pid` to 1.

## Parameter usage guide

### sysctl

- `sysctl conf_name` checks the current parameter value.
- `sysctl -w conf_name=value` modifies the parameter value. And your modification takes effect immediately.
- `sysctl -p`  loads parameter values ​​from related configuration files.

### Introduction to ulimit

`ulimit` sets the resource threshold for the current shell session. Please note that:

- Changes made by the `ulimit` command are valid only for the current session (and child processes).
- `ulimit` cannot adjust the (soft) threshold of a resource to a value greater than the current hard value.
- Ordinary users cannot adjust the hard threshold (even by using `sudo` ) through this command.
- To modify on the system level, or adjust the hard threshold, edit the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file. But this method needs to re-log in to take effect.

### prlimit

`prlimit` gets and sets process resource limits. You can modify the hard threshold by using it and the `sudo` command.
Together with the `sudo` command, the hard threshold can be modified. For example, `prlimit --nofile = 130000 --pid = $$` adjusts the maximum number of open files permitted by the current process to `14000`. And the modification takes effect immediately. Note that this command is only available in RedHat 7u or later OS versions.

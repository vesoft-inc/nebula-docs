# Configurations

This document gives some introduction to configurations in Nebula Graph.

For the path and usage of local configuration files for Nebula Graph services, see:

* [Meta configuration](2.meta-config.md)
* [Graph configuration](3.graph-config.md)
* [Storage configuration](4.storage-config.md)

## Get configurations

Most configurations are gflags. You can get all the gflags and the explanations by the following command.

```bash
<binary> --help
```

For example:

```bash
$ ./nebula-metad  --help
$ ./nebula-graphd --help
$ ./nebula-storaged --help
$ ./nebula-console --help
```

Besides, you can get the values of running flags by `curl`-ing from the services.

For example:

```bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:19559/flags # From Meta
$ curl 127.0.0.1:19669/flags # From Graph
$ curl 127.0.0.1:19779/flags # From Storage
```

## Modify configurations

We suggest that you change configurations from local configure files. To change configurations from local files, follow these steps:

1. Add `--local_config=true` to each configuration file.
    The configuration files are stored in `/usr/local/nebula/etc/` by default. If you have customized your Nebula Graph installation directory, the path to your configuration files is `$pwd/nebula/etc/`.
2. Save your modification to the files.
3. Restart the Nebula Graph services.

>**NOTE**: Remember to add  `--local_config=true` to each configuration file.
To make your modifications take effect, restart all the Nebula Graph services.

# Configurations

This document gives some introduction to configurations in Nebula Graph.

## Get configurations

By default, Nebula Graph gets configurations from the Meta Service. But we suggest that you get configurations from local. To get configurations from local, follow these steps:

1. Add `--local_config=true` to each configuration file.
    The configuration files are stored in `/usr/local/nebula/etc/` by default. If you have customized your Nebula Graph installation directory, the path to your configuration files is `$pwd/nebula/etc/`.
2. Save your modification in step one and close the configuration file.
3. Restart the Nebula Graph services.
    To make your modifications take effect, restart all the Nebula Graph services.

## Modify configurations

To modify configurations, edit the configuration files. To make your modifications take effect, add `--local_config=true` to each configuration file. For more information, see [Get configuration](#get_configuration).

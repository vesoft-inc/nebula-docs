# Configurations

This document gives some introduction to configurations in Nebula Graph.

## Get configurations

Most configurations are gflags. You can get all the gflags and the explanations by command like

```shell
binary --help
```

E.g.,
```shell
./nebula-metad  --help
./nebula-graphd --help
./nebula-storaged --help
./nebula-console --help
```

Besides, you can get the running flags' value by `curl`-ing to the service.

E.g.,
```shell
curl 127.0.0.1:19779/flags # to metad
curl 127.0.0.1:19669/flags # to graphd
curl 127.0.0.1:19559/flags # to storaged
```

## Modify configurations

We suggest that you change configurations from local configure files. To change configurations from local files, follow these steps:

1. Add `--local_config=true` to each configuration file.
    The configuration files are stored in `/usr/local/nebula/etc/` by default. If you have customized your Nebula Graph installation directory, the path to your configuration files is `$pwd/nebula/etc/`.
2. Save your modification to the files.
3. Restart the Nebula Graph services.

>**NOTE**: Remember to add  `--local_config=true` to each configuration file.
To make your modifications take effect, restart all the Nebula Graph services.

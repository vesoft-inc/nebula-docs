# Query Nebula Graph metrics

Nebula Graph supports querying the monitoring metrics through HTTP ports.

## Metrics structure

Each metric of Nebula Graph consists of three fields: name, type, and time range. The fields are separated by periods, for example, `num_queries.sum.600`. Different Nebula Graph services (Graph, Storage, or Meta) support different metrics. The detailed description is as follows.

|Field|Example|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Metric name|`num_queries`|Indicates the function of the metric.|
|Metric type|`sum`|Indicates how the metrics are collected. Supported types are SUM, AVG, RATE, and the P-th sample quantiles such as P75, P95, P99, and P99.9.|
|Time range|`600`|The time range in seconds for the metric collection. Supported values are 5, 60, 600, and 3600, representing the last 5 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes, and 1 hour.|

### Space-level metrics

The Graph service supports a set of space-level metrics that record the information of different graph spaces separately.

To enable space-level metrics, set the value of `enable_space_level_metrics` to `true` in the Graph service configuration file before starting Nebula Graph. For details about how to modify the configuration, see [Configuration Management](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md).

!!! note

    Space-level metrics can be queried only by querying all metrics. For example, run `curl -G "http://192.168.8.40:19559/stats"` to show all metrics. The returned result contains the graph space name in the form of '{space=space_name}', such as `num_active_queries{space=basketballplayer}.sum.5=0`.

## Query metrics over HTTP

### Syntax

```bash
curl -G "http://<ip>:<port>/stats?stats=<metric_name_list> [&format=json]"
```

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
|`ip`|The IP address of the server. You can find it in the configuration file in the installation directory.|
|`port`|The HTTP port of the server. You can find it in the configuration file in the installation directory. The default ports are 19559 (Meta), 19669 (Graph), and 19779 (Storage).|
|`metric_name_list`|The metrics names. Multiple metrics are separated by commas (,).|
|`&format=json`|Optional. Returns the result in the JSON format.|

!!! note

    If Nebula Graph is deployed with [Docker Compose](..//4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/3.deploy-nebula-graph-with-docker-compose.md), run `docker-compose ps` to check the ports that are mapped from the service ports inside of the container and then query through them.

### Examples

* Query a single metric

  Query the query number in the last 10 minutes in the Graph Service.

    ```bash
    $ curl -G "http://192.168.8.40:19669/stats?stats=num_queries.sum.600"
    num_queries.sum.600=400
    ```

* Query multiple metrics

  Query the following metrics together:

  * The average heartbeat latency in the last 1 minute.

  * The average latency of the slowest 1% heartbeats, i.e., the P99 heartbeats, in the last 10 minutes.

    ```bash
    $ curl -G "http://192.168.8.40:19559/stats?stats=heartbeat_latency_us.avg.60,heartbeat_latency_us.p99.600"
    heartbeat_latency_us.avg.60=281
    heartbeat_latency_us.p99.600=985
    ```

* Return a JSON result.

  Query the number of new vertices in the Storage Service in the last 10 minutes and return the result in the JSON format.

    ```bash
    $ curl -G "http://192.168.8.40:19779/stats?stats=num_add_vertices.sum.600&format=json"
    [{"value":1,"name":"num_add_vertices.sum.600"}]
    ```

* Query all metrics in a service.

  If no metric is specified in the query, Nebula Graph returns all metrics in the service.

    ```bash
    $ curl -G "http://192.168.8.40:19559/stats"
    heartbeat_latency_us.avg.5=304
    heartbeat_latency_us.avg.60=308
    heartbeat_latency_us.avg.600=299
    heartbeat_latency_us.avg.3600=285

    num_heartbeats.rate.5=0
    num_heartbeats.rate.60=0
    num_heartbeats.rate.600=0

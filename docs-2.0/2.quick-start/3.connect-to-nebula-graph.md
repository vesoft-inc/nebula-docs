# Connect to Nebula Graph

Nebula Graph supports multiple types of clients, including a CLI client, a GUI client, and clients developed in popular programming languages. This topic provides an overview of Nebula Graph clients and basic instructions on how to use the native CLI client, nebula-console.

If you don't have a Nebula Graph database yet, we recommend that you try the cloud service. [Nebula Graph Cloud Service](https://www.nebula-cloud.io/) supports on-demand deployment and fast building, and uses Nebula Graph Studio as its default client.

## Use nebula-console to connect to Nebula Graph

### Prerequisites

* You have started the Nebula Graph services. For how to start the services, see Start and Stop Nebula Graph services (doc TODO).
* The machine you plan to run nebula-console on has network access to the Nebula Graph services.

### Steps

1. On the [nebula-console Releases](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-console/releases "the nebula-console Releases page") page, select a nebula-console version and click **Assets**.

    > **NOTE:** We recommend that you select the latest release.

    ![Select a Nebula Graph version and click **Assets**](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/docs-2.0/2.quick-start/nebula-console-releases-1.png "Click Assets to show the available Nebula Graph binary files")

2. In the **Assets** area, find the correct binary file for the machine where you want to run nebula-console and download the file to the machine.

    ![Click to download the package according to your hardware architecture](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/docs-2.0/2.quick-start/nebula-console-releases-2-1.png "Click the package name to download it")

3. (Optional) Rename the binary file to `nebula-console` for convenience.

    >**NOTE:** For Windows, rename the file to `nebula-console.exe`.

4. On the machine to run nebula-console, grant the execute permission of the nebula-console binary file to the user.

    >**NOTE:** For Windows, skip this step.

    ```bash
    $ chmod 111 nebula-console
    ```

5. In the command line interface, change the working directory to the one where the nebula-console binary file is stored.

6. Run the following command to connect to Nebula Graph.

    * For Linux or macOS:

        ```bash
        $ ./nebula-console -addr <ip> -port <port> -u <username> -p <password>
        [-t 120] [-e "nGQL_statement" | -f filename.nGQL]
        ```

    * For Windows:

        ```powershell
        > nebula-console.exe -addr <ip> -port <port> -u <username> -p <password>
        [-t 120] [-e "nGQL_statement" | -f filename.nGQL]
        ```

    The description of the parameters is as follows.

    | Option | Description |
    | - | - |
    | `-h` | Shows the help menu. |
    | `-addr` | Sets the IP address of the graphd service. The default address is 127.0.0.1. |
    | `-port` | Sets the port number of the graphd service. The default port number is 3699. If you have deployed Nebula Graph in a docker container but nebula-console is working outside the container, check the [source port](2.deploy-nebula-graph-with-docker-compose.md/#check_the_nebula_graph_service_status_and_port) of any nebula-graphd process and use it for connection.|
    | `-u/-user` | Sets the username of your Nebula Graph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the username. |
    | `-p/-password` | Sets the password of your Nebula Graph account. Before enabling authentication, you can use any characters as the password. |
    | `-t/-timeout`  | Sets an integer-type timeout threshold of the connection. The unit is second. The default value is 120. |
    | `-e/-eval` | Sets a string-type nGQL statement. The nGQL statement is executed once the connection succeeds. The connection stops after the result is returned. |
    | `-f/-file` | Sets the path of an nGQL file. The nGQL statements in the file are executed once the connection succeeds. You'll get the return messages and the connection stops then. |

## Nebula-console export mode

When the export mode is enabled, nebula-console exports all the query results into a CSV file. When the export mode is disabled, the export stops. The syntax is as follows.

> **NOTE**: The following commands are case insensitive.

* Enable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :SET CSV <your_file.csv>;
```

* Disable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :UNSET CSV;
```

## Disconnect nebula-console from Nebula Graph

You can use `:EXIT` or `:QUIT` to disconnect from Nebula Graph. For convenience, nebula-console supports using these commands in lower case without the colon (":"), such as `quit`.

```nGQL
nebula> :QUIT

Bye root!
```

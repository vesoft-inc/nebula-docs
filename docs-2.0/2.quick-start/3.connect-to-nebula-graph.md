# Connect to Nebula Graph

Nebula Graph supports multiple types of clients, including a CLI client, a GUI client, and clients developed in popular programming languages. This topic provides an overview of Nebula Graph clients and a basic instruction on how to use the native CLI client, nebula-console.

If you don't have a Nebula Graph database yet, we recommend that you try the cloud service. [Nebula Graph Cloud Service](https://www.nebula-cloud.io/) supports on-demand deployment and fast building, and uses Nebula Graph Studio as its default client.

## Use nebula-console to connect to Nebula Graph

1. Download [the nebula-console binary file]([TODO](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-console/releases)).

2. Use the binary file to connect to Nebula Graph.

    ```bash
    $ ./nebula-console -addr <ip> -port <port> -u <username> -p <password>
    [-t 120] [-e "nGQL_statement" | -f filename.nGQL]
    ```

    | Option       | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Nebula-console export mode

When the export mode is enabled, nebula-console exports all the query results into a CSV file. When the export mode is disabled, the export stops. The syntax is as follows.

> **NOTE**: The following commands are case insensitive.

* Enable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :SET CSV <your_file.csv>;
```

* Disable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :UNSET CSV;
```

## Disconnect nebula-console from Nebula Graph

You can use `:EXIT` or `:QUIT` to disconnect from Nebula Graph. For convenience, nebula-console supports using these commands in lower case without the colon (":"), such as `quit`.

```nGQL
nebula> :QUIT

Bye root!
```

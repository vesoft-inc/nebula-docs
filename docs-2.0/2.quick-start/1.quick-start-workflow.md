The quick start introduces the simplest workflow to use Nebula Graph, including deploying Nebula Graph, connecting to Nebula Graph, and doing basic CRUD.

## Steps

Users can quickly deploy and use Nebula Graph in the following steps.

1. [Deploy Nebula Graph](2.install-nebula-graph.md)

  Users can use the RPM or DEB file to quickly deploy Nebula Graph. For other deployment methods and the corresponding preparations, see the **Deployment and installation** chapter.

2. [Start Nebula Graph](5.start-stop-service.md)

  Users need to start Nebula Graph after deployment.

3. [Connect to Nebula Graph](3.connect-to-nebula-graph.md)

  Then users can use clients to connect to Nebula Graph. Nebula Graph supports a variety of clients. This topic will describe how to use Nebula Console to connect to Nebula Graph.

4. [Register the Storage Service](3.1add-storage-hosts.md)

  When connecting to Nebula Graph for the first time, users must register the Storage Service before querying data.

5. [CRUD in Nebula Graph](4.nebula-graph-crud.md)

  Users can use nGQL (Nebula Graph Query Language) to run CRUD after connecting to Nebula Graph.

# Quick start workflow

The quick start introduces the simplest workflow to using Nebula Graph, including deploying Nebula Graph, connecting to Nebula Graph, and doing basic CRUD.

1. [Deploy Nebula Graph with Docker Compose](2.deploy-nebula-graph-with-docker-compose.md)

2. [Connect to Nebula Graph](3.connect-to-nebula-graph.md)

3. [CRUD in Nebula Graph](4.nebula-graph-crud.md)

Other frequently read topics are recommended as follows. They are not in the quick start, but you may need them as soon as you pass the quick start phase.

* Deploy a Nebula Graph cluster (TODO)
* [Compaction and job management](../3.ngql-guide/18.operation-and-maintenance-statements\4.job-statements.md)

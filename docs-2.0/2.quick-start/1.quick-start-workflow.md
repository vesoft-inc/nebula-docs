# Quick start workflow

The quick start introduces the simplest workflow to use NebulaGraph, including deploying NebulaGraph, connecting to NebulaGraph, and doing basic CRUD.

## Steps

Users can quickly deploy and use NebulaGraph in the following steps.

1. [Deploy NebulaGraph](2.install-nebula-graph.md)

  Users can use the RPM or DEB file to quickly deploy NebulaGraph. For other deployment methods and the corresponding preparations, see the **Deployment and installation** chapter.

2. [Start NebulaGraph](5.start-stop-service.md)

  Users need to start NebulaGraph after deployment.

3. [Connect to NebulaGraph](3.connect-to-nebula-graph.md)

  Then users can use clients to connect to NebulaGraph. NebulaGraph supports a variety of clients. This topic will describe how to use Nebula Console to connect to NebulaGraph.

4. [Register the Storage Service](3.1add-storage-hosts.md)

  When connecting to NebulaGraph for the first time, users must register the Storage Service before querying data.

5. [CRUD in NebulaGraph](4.nebula-graph-crud.md)

  Users can use nGQL (NebulaGraph Query Language) to run CRUD after connecting to NebulaGraph.

## Prerequisites

* You have installed the following applications on your host.

  | Application    | Recommended version | Official installation reference                                    |
  | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Docker         | Latest              | [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)   |
  | Docker Compose | Latest              | [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) |
  | Git            | Latest              | [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)       |

* If you are deploying Nebula Graph as a non-root user, grant the user with Docker-related privileges. For a detailed instruction, see [Docker document: Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

* You have started the Docker service on your host.

* If you have already deployed another version of Nebula Graph with Docker Compose on your host, to avoid compatibility issues, back up [the service data](#check_the_service_data_and_logs) if you need, and delete the `nebula-docker-compose/data` directory.

  !!! note

        To backup the Nebula Graph data, see Use B&R to [backup data](../20.appendix/6.eco-tool-version.md). TODO: It is not released.

## How to deploy

1. Clone the `master` branch of the `nebula-docker-compose` repository to your host with Git.

  !!! danger

        The `master` branch contains the Docker Compose solution for the latest Nebula Graph development release. **DON'T** use this release for production.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose.git
    ```

2. Go to the `nebula-docker-compose` directory.

    ```bash
    $ cd nebula-docker-compose/
    ```

3. Run the following command to start all the Nebula Graph services.

  !!! note

        Update the [Nebula Graph images](#how-to-upgrade-nebula-graph-services) and [Nebula Console images](#how-to-update-the-nebula-console-client) first if they are out of date.

    ```bash
    nebula-docker-compose]$ docker-compose up -d
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad0_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad2_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_metad1_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_graphd2_1   ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_graphd_1    ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_graphd1_1   ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged0_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged2_1 ... done
    Creating nebula-docker-compose_storaged1_1 ... done
    ```

  !!! note

        For more information of the preceding services, see [Nebula Graph architecture](../1.introduction/3.nebula-graph-architecture/1.architecture-overview.md).

4. Connect to Nebula Graph.

   1. Run the following command to start a new docker container with the Nebula Console image, and connect the container to the network where Nebula Graph is deployed.

      ```bash
      $ docker run --rm -ti --network nebula-docker-compose_nebula-net \
      --entrypoint=/bin/sh vesoft/nebula-console:v2-nightly
      ```

    !!! note

        Your local network  (nebula-docker-compose_nebula-net) may be different from the example above. Use the following command.

        ```bash
        $ docker network  ls
        NETWORK ID          NAME                               DRIVER              SCOPE
        a74c312b1d16        bridge                             bridge              local
        dbfa82505f0e        host                               host                local
        ed55ccf356ae        nebula-docker-compose_nebula-net   bridge              local
        93ba48b4b288        none                               null                local
        ```

   2. Connect to Nebula Graph with Nebula Console.

      ```bash
      docker> nebula-console -u user -p password --address=graphd --port=9669
      ```

    !!! note

        By default, the authentication is off, you can log in with any user name and password. To turn it on, see [Enable authentication](../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md).

   3. Run the `SHOW HOSTS` statement to check the status of the `nebula-storaged` processes.

      ```bash
      nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
      +-------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
      | Host        | Port | Status   | Leader count | Leader distribution  | Partition distribution |
      +-------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
      | "storaged0" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No valid partition"   |
      +-------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
      | "storaged1" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No valid partition"   |
      +-------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
      | "storaged2" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No valid partition"   |
      +-------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
      | "Total"     |      |          | 0            |                      |                        |
      +-------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
      ```

5. Run `exit` twice to switch back to your terminal (shell). You can run Step 4 to login Nebula Graph again.

## Check the Nebula Graph service status and port

Run `docker-compose ps` to list all the services of Nebula Graph and their status and ports.

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
nebula-docker-compose_graphd1_1     /usr/local/nebula/bin/nebu ...   Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:33170->19669/tcp, 0.0.0.0:33169->19670/tcp, 0.0.0.0:33173->9669/tcp

                                                                                    0.0.0.0:33185->9779/tcp, 9780/tcp
```

Nebula Graph provides services to the clients through port `9669` by default. To use other ports, modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the `nebula-docker-compose` directory and restart the Nebula Graph services.

## Check the service data and logs

All the data and logs of Nebula Graph are stored persistently in the `nebula-docker-compose/data` and `nebula-docker-compose/logs` directories.

The structure of the directories is as follows:

```text
nebula-docker-compose/
  |-- docker-compose.yaml
  ├── data
  │   ├── meta0
  │   ├── meta1
  │   ├── meta2
  │   ├── storage0
  │   ├── storage1
  │   └── storage2
  └── logs
      ├── graph
      ├── graph1
      ├── graph2
      ├── meta0
      ├── meta1
      ├── meta2
      ├── storage0
      ├── storage1
      └── storage2
```

## Stop the Nebula Graph services

You can run the following command to stop the Nebula Graph services:

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

The following information indicates you have successfully stopped the Nebula Graph services:

```bash
Stopping nebula-docker-compose_storaged0_1 ... done
Stopping nebula-docker-compose_graphd1_1   ... done
Stopping nebula-docker-compose_graphd_1    ... done

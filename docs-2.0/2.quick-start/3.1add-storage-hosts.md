# Register the Storage Service

When connecting to NebulaGraph for the first time, you have to add the Storage hosts, and confirm that all the hosts are online.

!!! compatibility

    - Starting from NebulaGraph 3.0.0, you have to run `ADD HOSTS` before reading or writing data into the Storage Service.
    - For NebulaGraph of versions earlier than 3.0.0 and NebulaGraph Cloud clusters, `ADD HOSTS` is not needed. 

## Prerequisites

You have [connected to NebulaGraph](3.connect-to-nebula-graph.md).

## Steps

1. Add the Storage hosts.

  Run the following command to add hosts:

  ```ngql
  ADD HOSTS <ip>:<port> [,<ip>:<port> ...];
  ```

  Exampleï¼š

  ```ngql
  nebula> ADD HOSTS 192.168.10.100:9779, 192.168.10.101:9779, 192.168.10.102:9779;
  ```

  !!! caution

        Make sure that the IP you added is the same as the IP configured for `local_ip` in the `nebula-storaged.conf` file. Otherwise, the Storage service will fail to start. For information about configurations, see [Configurations](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md).  

2. Check the status of the hosts to make sure that they are all online.

  ```ngql
  nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
  +------------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------  +------------------------+---------+
  | Host             | Port | Status   | Leader count | Leader distribution  |   Partition distribution | Version |
  +------------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------  +------------------------+---------+
  | "192.168.10.100" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No   valid partition"   | "{{nebula.release}}" |
  | "192.168.10.101" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No   valid partition"   | "{{nebula.release}}"|
  | "192.168.10.102" | 9779 | "ONLINE" | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No   valid partition"   | "{{nebula.release}}"|
  +------------------+------+----------+--------------+----------------------  +------------------------+---------+
  ```

  The `Status` column of the result above shows that all Storage hosts are online.

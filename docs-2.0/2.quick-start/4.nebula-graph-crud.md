# Step 4: Use nGQL (CRUD)

This topic will describe the basic CRUD operations in Nebula Graph.

For more information, see [nGQL guide](../3.ngql-guide/1.nGQL-overview/1.overview.md).

## Graph space and Nebula Graph schema

A Nebula Graph instance consists of one or more graph spaces. Graph spaces are physically isolated from each other. You can use different graph spaces in the same instance to store different datasets.

![Nebula Graph and graph spaces](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/docs-2.0/2.quick-start/nebula-graph-instance-and-graph-spaces.png)

To insert data into a graph space, define a schema for the graph database. Nebula Graph schema is based on the following components.

| Schema component | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                      |
| Vertex           | Represents an entity in the real world. A vertex can have one or more tags.                                  |
| Tag              | The type of the same group of vertices. It defines a set of properties that describes the types of vertices. |
| Edge             | Represents a **directed** relationship between two vertices.                                                 |
| Edge type        | The type of an edge. It defines a group of properties that describes the types of edges.                     |

For more information, see [Data modeling](../1.introduction/2.data-model.md).

In this topic, we will use the following dataset to demonstrate basic CRUD operations.

![The demo dataset](dataset-for-crud.png)

## Check the machine status in the Nebula Graph cluster

!!! Note

    First, we recommend that you check the machine status to make sure that all the Storage services are connected to the Meta services. Run `SHOW HOSTS` as follows.

```ngql
nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
+-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
| Host        | Port      | Status    | Leader count | Leader distribution  | Partition distribution |
+-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
| "storaged0" | 9779      | "ONLINE"  | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No valid partition"   |
| "storaged1" | 9779      | "ONLINE"  | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No valid partition"   |
| "storaged2" | 9779      | "ONLINE"  | 0            | "No valid partition" | "No valid partition"   |
| "Total"     | __EMPTY__ | __EMPTY__ | 0            | __EMPTY__            | __EMPTY__              |
+-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------------+
```

From the **Status** column of the table in the return results, you can see that all the Storage services are online.

### Asynchronous implementation of creation and alteration

!!! caution

    Nebula Graph implements the following creation or alteration operations asynchronously in the **next** heartbeat cycle. The operations will not take effect until they finish.

* `CREATE SPACE`
* `CREATE TAG`
* `CREATE EDGE`
* `ALTER TAG`
* `ALTER EDGE`
* `CREATE TAG INDEX`
* `CREATE EDGE INDEX`

!!! note

    The default heartbeat interval is 10 seconds. To change the heartbeat interval, modify the `heartbeat_interval_secs` parameter in the [configuration files](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/1.configurations.md) for all services.

To make sure the follow-up operations work as expected, take one of the following approaches:

* Run `SHOW` or `DESCRIBE` statements accordingly to check the status of the objects, and make sure the creation or alteration is complete. If it is not, wait a few seconds and try again.

* Wait for two heartbeat cycles, i.e., 20 seconds.

## Create and use a graph space

### nGQL syntax

* Create a graph space:

    ```ngql
    CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] <graph_space_name> (
    [partition_num = <partition_number>,]
    [replica_factor = <replica_number>,]
    vid_type = {FIXED_STRING(<N>) | INT64}
    )
    [COMMENT = '<comment>'];
    ```

    For more information on parameters, see [CREATE SPACE](../3.ngql-guide/9.space-statements/1.create-space.md).

    <!-- `charset` and `collate` now each has only one value. Omit the two options for now.
        charset = <charset>
        collate = <collate>
    -->

* List graph spaces and check if the creation is successful:

    ```ngql
    nebula> SHOW SPACES;
    ```

* Use a graph space:

    ```ngql
    USE <graph_space_name>;
    ```

### Examples

1. Use the following statement to create a graph space named `basketballplayer`.

    ```ngql
    nebula> CREATE SPACE basketballplayer(partition_num=15, replica_factor=1, vid_type=fixed_string(30));
    ```

2. Check the partition distribution with `SHOW HOSTS` to make sure that the partitions are distributed in a balanced way.

    ```ngql
    nebula> SHOW HOSTS;
    +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------------+------------------------+
    | Host        | Port      | Status    | Leader count | Leader distribution              | Partition distribution |
    +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------------+------------------------+
    | "storaged0" | 9779      | "ONLINE"  | 5            | "basketballplayer:5"             | "basketballplayer:5"   |
    | "storaged1" | 9779      | "ONLINE"  | 5            | "basketballplayer:5"             | "basketballplayer:5"   |
    | "storaged2" | 9779      | "ONLINE"  | 5            | "basketballplayer:5"             | "basketballplayer:5"   |
    | "Total"     |           |           | 15           | "basketballplayer:15"            | "basketballplayer:15"  |
    +-------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------------+------------------------+
    ```

    If the **Leader distribution** is uneven, use `BALANCE LEADER` to redistribute the partitions. For more information, see [BALANCE](../8.service-tuning/load-balance.md).

3. Use the `basketballplayer` graph space.

    ```ngql
    nebula[(none)]> USE basketballplayer;
    ```

    You can use `SHOW SPACES` to check the graph space you created.

    ```ngql
    nebula> SHOW SPACES;
    +--------------------+
    | Name               |
    +--------------------+
    | "basketballplayer" |
    +--------------------+
    ```

## Create tags and edge types

### nGQL syntax

```ngql
CREATE {TAG | EDGE} {<tag_name> | <edge_type>}(<property_name> <data_type>
[, <property_name> <data_type> ...])
[COMMENT = '<comment>'];
```

For more information on parameters, see [CREATE TAG](../3.ngql-guide/10.tag-statements/1.create-tag.md) and [CREATE EDGE](../3.ngql-guide/11.edge-type-statements/1.create-edge.md).

### Examples

Create tags `player` and `team`, edge types `follow` and `serve`. Descriptions are as follows.

| Component name | Type      | Property                         |
| :---           | :---      | :---                             |
| player         | Tag       | name (string), age (int)         |
| team           | Tag       | name (string)                    |
| follow         | Edge type | degree (int)                     |
| serve          | Edge type | start_year (int), end_year (int) |

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG player(name string, age int);

nebula> CREATE TAG team(name string);

nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(degree int);

nebula> CREATE EDGE serve(start_year int, end_year int);
```

## Insert vertices and edges

Users can use the `INSERT` statement to insert vertices or edges based on existing tags or edge types.

### nGQL syntax

* Insert vertices:

    ```ngql
    INSERT VERTEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <tag_name> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...])
    [, <tag_name> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]), ...]
    VALUES <vid>: (<property_value>[, <property_value>...])
    [, <vid>: (<property_value>[, <property_value>...];
    ```

    `VID` is short for Vertex ID. A `VID` must be a unique string value in a graph space. For details, see [INSERT VERTEX](../3.ngql-guide/12.vertex-statements/1.insert-vertex.md).

* Insert edges:

    ```ngql
    INSERT EDGE [IF NOT EXISTS] <edge_type> (<property_name>[, <property_name>...])
    VALUES <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] : (<property_value>[, <property_value>...])
    [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] : (<property_name>[, <property_name>...]), ...];
    ```

   For more information on parameters, see [INSERT EDGE](../3.ngql-guide/13.edge-statements/1.insert-edge.md).

### Examples

* Insert vertices representing basketball players and teams:

    ```ngql
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player100":("Tim Duncan", 42);
    
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player101":("Tony Parker", 36);
    
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name, age) VALUES "player102":("LaMarcus Aldridge", 33);
    
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX team(name) VALUES "team203":("Trail Blazers"), "team204":("Spurs");
    ```

* Insert edges representing the relations between basketball players and teams:

    ```ngql
    nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player101" -> "player100":(95);
    
    nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player101" -> "player102":(90);
    
    nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(degree) VALUES "player102" -> "player100":(75);
    
    nebula> INSERT EDGE serve(start_year, end_year) VALUES "player101" -> "team204":(1999, 2018),"player102" -> "team203":(2006,  2015);
    ```

## Read data

* The [GO](../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/3.go.md) statement can traverse the database based on specific conditions. A `GO` traversal starts from one or more vertices, along one or more edges, and returns information in a form specified in the `YIELD` clause.

* The [FETCH](../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/4.fetch.md) statement is used to get properties from vertices or edges.

* The [LOOKUP](../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/5.lookup.md) statement is based on [indexes](#about_indexes). It is used together with the `WHERE` clause to search for the data that meet the specific conditions.

* The [MATCH](../3ngql-guide/../3.ngql-guide/7.general-query-statements/2.match.md) statement is the most commonly used statement for graph data querying. It can describe all kinds of graph patterns, but it relies on [indexes](#about_indexes) to match data patterns in Nebula Graph. Therefore, its performance still needs optimization.

### nGQL syntax

* `GO`

    ```ngql
    GO [[<M> TO] <N> STEPS ] FROM <vertex_list>
    OVER <edge_type_list> [{REVERSELY | BIDIRECT}]
    [ WHERE <conditions> ]
    YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list>
    [{SAMPLE <sample_list> | LIMIT <limit_list>}]
    [| GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position} YIELD <col_name>]
    [| ORDER BY <expression> [{ASC | DESC}]]
    [| LIMIT [<offset>,] <number_rows>];
    ```

* `FETCH`

  * Fetch properties on tags:

    ```ngql
    FETCH PROP ON {<tag_name>[, tag_name ...] | *}
    <vid> [, vid ...]
    YIELD <return_list> [AS <alias>];
    ```

  * Fetch properties on edges:

    ```ngql
    FETCH PROP ON <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>] [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid> ...]
    YIELD <output>;
    ```

* `LOOKUP`

    ```ngql
    LOOKUP ON {<vertex_tag> | <edge_type>}
    [WHERE <expression> [AND <expression> ...]]
    YIELD <return_list> [AS <alias>];
    ```

* `MATCH`

    ```nGQL
    MATCH <pattern> [<WHERE clause>] RETURN <output>;
    ```

### Examples of `GO` statement

* Search for the players that the player with VID `player101` follows.

    ```ngql
    nebula> GO FROM "player101" OVER follow YIELD id($$);
    +-------------+
    | id($$)      |
    +-------------+
    | "player100" |
    | "player102" |
    | "player125" |
    +-------------+
    ```

* Filter the players that the player with VID `player101` follows whose age is equal to or greater than 35. Rename the corresponding columns in the results with `Teammate` and `Age`.

    ```ngql
    nebula> GO FROM "player101" OVER follow WHERE properties($$).age >= 35 \
            YIELD properties($$).name AS Teammate, properties($$).age AS Age;
    +-----------------+-----+
    | Teammate        | Age |
    +-----------------+-----+
    | "Tim Duncan"    | 42  |
    | "Manu Ginobili" | 41  |
    +-----------------+-----+
    ```

    | Clause/Sign | Description                                                         |
    |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `YIELD`     | Specifies what values or results you want to return from the query. |
    | `$$`        | Represents the target vertices.                                     |
    | `\`         | A line-breaker.                                                     |

* Search for the players that the player with VID `player101` follows. Then Retrieve the teams of the players that the player with VID `player100` follows. To combine the two queries, use a pipe or a temporary variable.

  * With a pipe:

    ```ngql
    nebula> GO FROM "player101" OVER follow YIELD dst(edge) AS id | \
            GO FROM $-.id OVER serve YIELD properties($$).name AS Team, \
            properties($^).name AS Player;
    +-----------------+---------------------+
    | Team            | Player              |
    +-----------------+---------------------+
    | "Spurs"         | "Tim Duncan"        |
    | "Trail Blazers" | "LaMarcus Aldridge" |
    | "Spurs"         | "LaMarcus Aldridge" |
    | "Spurs"         | "Manu Ginobili"     |
    +-----------------+---------------------+
    ```

    |Clause/Sign|Description|
    |-|-|
    |`$^`|Represents the source vertex of the edge.|
    |`|`|A pipe symbol can combine multiple queries.|
    |`$-`|Represents the outputs of the query before the pipe symbol.|

  * With a temporary variable:

    !!! note

        Once a composite statement is submitted to the server as a whole, the life cycle of the temporary variables in the statement ends.

    ```ngql
    nebula> $var = GO FROM "player101" OVER follow YIELD dst(edge) AS id; \
            GO FROM $var.id OVER serve YIELD properties($$).name AS Team, \
            properties($^).name AS Player;
    +-----------------+---------------------+
    | Team            | Player              |
    +-----------------+---------------------+
    | "Spurs"         | "Tim Duncan"        |
    | "Trail Blazers" | "LaMarcus Aldridge" |
    | "Spurs"         | "LaMarcus Aldridge" |
    | "Spurs"         | "Manu Ginobili"     |
    +-----------------+---------------------+
    ```

### Example of `FETCH` statement

Use `FETCH`: Fetch the properties of the player with VID `player100`.

```ngql
nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player100" YIELD properties(vertex);
+-------------------------------+
| properties(VERTEX)            |
+-------------------------------+
| {age: 42, name: "Tim Duncan"} |
+-------------------------------+
```

!!! Note

    The examples of `LOOKUP` and `MATCH` statements are in [indexes](#about_indexes).

## Update vertices and edges

Users can use the `UPDATE` or the `UPSERT` statements to update existing data.

`UPSERT` is the combination of `UPDATE` and `INSERT`. If you update a vertex or an edge with `UPSERT`, the database will insert a new vertex or edge if it does not exist.

!!! Note

    `UPSERT` operates serially in a partition-based order. Therefore, it is slower than `INSERT` OR `UPDATE`. And `UPSERT` has concurrency only between multiple partitions.

### nGQL syntax

* `UPDATE` vertices:

    ```ngql
    UPDATE VERTEX <vid> SET <properties to be updated>
    [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>];
    ```

* `UPDATE` edges:

    ```ngql
    UPDATE EDGE <source vid> -> <destination vid> [@rank] OF <edge_type>
    SET <properties to be updated> [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns to be output>];
    ```

* `UPSERT` vertices or edges:

    ```ngql
    UPSERT {VERTEX <vid> | EDGE <edge_type>} SET <update_columns>
    [WHEN <condition>] [YIELD <columns>];
    ```

### Examples

* `UPDATE` the `name` property of the vertex with VID `player100` and check the result with the `FETCH` statement.

    ```ngql
    nebula> UPDATE VERTEX "player100" SET player.name = "Tim";

    nebula> FETCH PROP ON player "player100" YIELD properties(vertex);
    +------------------------+
    | properties(VERTEX)     |
    +------------------------+
    | {age: 42, name: "Tim"} |
    +------------------------+
    ```

* `UPDATE` the `degree` property of an edge and check the result with the `FETCH` statement.

    ```ngql
    nebula> UPDATE EDGE "player101" -> "player100" OF follow SET degree = 96;

    nebula> FETCH PROP ON follow "player101" -> "player100" YIELD properties(edge);
    +------------------+
    | properties(EDGE) |
    +------------------+
    | {degree: 96}     |
    +------------------+
    ```

* Insert a vertex with VID `player111` and `UPSERT` it.

    ```ngql
    nebula> INSERT VERTEX player(name,age) VALUES "player111":("David West", 38);
    
    nebula> UPSERT VERTEX "player111" SET player.name = "David", player.age = $^.player.age + 11 \
            WHEN $^.player.name == "David West" AND $^.player.age > 20 \
            YIELD $^.player.name AS Name, $^.player.age AS Age;
    +---------+-----+
    | Name    | Age |
    +---------+-----+
    | "David" | 49  |
    +---------+-----+
    ```

## Delete vertices and edges

### nGQL syntax

* Delete vertices:

    ```ngql
    DELETE VERTEX <vid1>[, <vid2>...]
    ```

* Delete edges:

    ```ngql
    DELETE EDGE <edge_type> <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>[@<rank>]
    [, <src_vid> -> <dst_vid>...]
    ```

### Examples

* Delete vertices:

    ```ngql
    nebula> DELETE VERTEX "player111", "team203";
    ```

* Delete edges:

    ```ngql
    nebula> DELETE EDGE follow "player101" -> "team204";
    ```

## About indexes

Users can add indexes to tags and edge types with the [CREATE INDEX](../3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/1.create-native-index.md) statement.

!!! caution "Must-read for using indexes"

    Both `MATCH` and `LOOKUP` statements depend on the indexes. But indexes can dramatically reduce the write performance (as much as 90% or even more). **DO NOT** use indexes in production environments unless you are fully aware of their influences on your service.

    Users **MUST** rebuild indexes for pre-existing data. Otherwise, the pre-existing data cannot be indexed and therefore cannot be returned in `MATCH` or `LOOKUP` statements. For more information, see [REBUILD INDEX](../3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/4.rebuild-native-index.md).

### nGQL syntax

* Create an index:

    ```ngql
    CREATE {TAG | EDGE} INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] <index_name>
    ON {<tag_name> | <edge_name>} ([<prop_name_list>]) [COMMENT = '<comment>'];
    ```

* Rebuild an index:

    ```ngql
    REBUILD {TAG | EDGE} INDEX <index_name>;
    ```

!!! note

    Define the index length when creating an index for a variable-length property. In UTF-8 encoding, a non-ascii character occupies 3 bytes. You should set an appropriate index length according to the variable-length property. For example, the index should be 30 bytes for 10 non-ascii characters. For more information, see [CREATE INDEX](../3.ngql-guide/14.native-index-statements/1.create-native-index.md)

### Examples of `LOOKUP` and `MATCH` (index-based)

Make sure there is an [index](#about_indexes) for `LOOKUP` or `MATCH` to use. If there is not, create an index first.

Find the information of the vertex with the tag `player` and its value of the `name` property is `Tony Parker`.

This example creates the index `player_index_1` on the player name property.

```nGQL
nebula> CREATE TAG INDEX IF NOT EXISTS player_index_1 ON player(name(20));
```

This example rebuilds the index to make sure it takes effect on pre-existing data.

```nGQL
nebula> REBUILD TAG INDEX player_index_1
+------------+
| New Job Id |
+------------+
| 31         |
+------------+
Got 1 rows (time spent 2379/3033 us)
```

This example uses the `LOOKUP` statement to retrieve the vertex property.

```nGQL
nebula> LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == "Tony Parker" \
        YIELD properties(vertex).name AS name, properties(vertex).age AS age;
+---------------+-----+
| name          | age |
+---------------+-----+
| "Tony Parker" | 36  |
+---------------+-----+
```

This example uses the `MATCH` statement to retrieve the vertex property.

```nGQL
nebula> MATCH (v:player{name:"Tony Parker"}) RETURN v;
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| v                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| ("player101" :player{age: 36, name: "Tony Parker"}) |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

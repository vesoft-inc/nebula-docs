# Data model

This document gives some introduction to Nebula Graph data model. A data model is a model that organizes data and specify how they are related to one another.

## Data structures

Nebula Graph data model uses five data structures to store data. They are vertices, edges, properties, tags and edge types.

- **Vertices**: Vertices are used to store entities.
  - In Nebula Graph, vertices are identified with vertices identifiers (i.e. `VID`). The `VID` must be unique in the same graph space.
  - A vertex must have at least one tag.
- **Edges**: Edges are used to connect vertices. An edge is a connection or a behavior between two vertices.
  - An edge is identified uniquely with a source vertex, an edge type, a rank value, and a destination vertex.
  - Edges are directed. `->` identifies the directions of edges. Edges can be traversed in either direction.
  - An edge must have one and only one edge type.
  - Rank value is an immutable user-assigned 64-bit signed integer. It identifies the edges with the same edge type between two vertices. Edges with higher rank values comes first. The default rank value is zero.
- **Properties**: Properties are key value pairs. Both vertices and edges are containers for properties.
- **Tags**: Tags are used to categorize vertices. Vertices that have the same tag are collected into a group.
- **Edge types**: Edge types are used to categorize edges. Edges have the same edge type are collected into a group.

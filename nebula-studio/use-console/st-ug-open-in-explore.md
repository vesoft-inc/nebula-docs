# Open in Explore

With the **Open in Explore** function, you can run nGQL statements on the **Console** tab page to query vertex or edge data and then view the result on the **Explore** page in a visualized way.

## Studio version

Studio of v1.2.1-beta or later versions supports this function. To update the version, run this command.

```bash
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

## Prerequisites

To use the **Open in Explore** function, you must do a check of these:

- The version of Studio is v1.2.1-beta or later.
- Studio is connected to Nebula Graph.
- A dataset exists in the database.

## Query and visualize edge data

To query edge data on the **Console** tab page and then view the result on the **Explore** tab page, follow these steps:

1. In the toolbar, click the **Console** tab.
2. In the **Current Graph Space** field, choose a graph space name. In this example, **mooc_actions** is chosen.
3. In the input box, enter an nGQL statement and click the ![Icon of Run](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-008.png "Run") icon.  
   > **NOTE**: The queried result must contain the VIDs of the source vertex and the destination vertex of an edge.

   Here is an nGQL statement example.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> GO FROM 56 OVER action YIELD action._src, action._dst;
    ```

    The queried result gives the edges between the user with ID 56 and the courses that he/she takes on the MOOC platform, as shown in this figure.

4. Click the **Open in Explore** button.
5. In the dialog box, configure as follows:  
   a. Click **Edge Type**.  
   b. In the **Edge Type** field, enter an edge type name. In this example, `action` is used.  
   c. In the **Src ID** field, choose a column name from the result table representing the VIDs of the source vertices. In this example, `action._src` is chosen.  
   d. In the **Dst ID** field, choose a column name from the result table representing the VIDs of the destination vertices. In this example, `action._dst` is chosen.  
   e. (Optional) If the result table contains the ranking information of the edges, in the **Rank** field, choose a column name representing the `rank` of the edges. If no ranking information exists in the result, leave the **Rank** field blank.  
   f. When the configuration is done, click the **Import** button.

6. (Optional) If some data exists on the board of **Explore**, choose a method to insert data:

   - **Incremental Insertion**: Click this button to add the result to the existing data on the board.
   - **Insert After Clear**: Click this button to clear the existing data from the board and then add the data to the board.

When the data is inserted, you can view the visualized representation of the edge data.

## Query and visualize vertex data

To query vertex data on the **Console** tab page and then view the result on the **Explore** tab page, follow these steps:

1. In the toolbar, click the **Console** tab.
2. In the **Current Graph Space** field, choose a graph space name. In this example, **mooc_actions** is chosen.
3. In the input box, enter an nGQL statement and click the ![Icon of Run](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-008.png "Run") icon.
   > **NOTE**: The queried result must contain the VIDs of the vertices.

   Here is an nGQL statement example.

    ```nGQL
    nebula> FETCH PROP ON * hash("Media History and Theory"); -- For the mooc_actions dataset, the VIDs of the course vertices are generated by Hash("<courseName>").
    ```

    The queried result gives the course with ID 8, as shown in this figure.

4. Click the **Open in Explore** button.
5. In the dialog box, configure as follows:  
   a. Click **Vertex**.  
   b. In the **Vertex ID** field, choose a column name from the result table representing the VIDs of the vertices. In this example, `VertexID` is chosen.  
   c. When the configuration is done, click the **Import** button.

      ![The dialog box for you to configure the vertex data](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/nebula-studio-docs/st-ug-047.png "Configure vertex data")  
6. (Optional) If some data exists on the board of **Explore**, choose a method to insert data:

   - **Incremental Insertion**: Click this button to add the queried result to the existing data on the board.
   - **Insert After Clear**: Click this button to clear the existing data from the board and then add the data.

When the data is inserted, you can view the visualized representation of the vertex data.

## Next to do

On the **Explore** tab page, you can expand the board to explore and analyze graph data.

# What is Nebula Graph Studio

Nebula Graph Studio (Studio in short) is a browser-based visualization tool to manage Nebula Graph. It provides you with a graphical user interface to manipulate graph schemas, import data, explore graph data, and run nGQL statements to retrieve data. With Studio, you can quickly become a graph exploration expert from scratch.

## Release distributions

Studio has two release distributions:

- Docker-based Studio: You can deploy Studio with Docker and connect Studio to Nebula Graph. For more information, see [Deploy Studio](../install-configure/st-ug-deploy.md).  

- Studio on Cloud: When you created a Nebula Graph instance on Nebula Graph Cloud Service, you can connect to Studio on Cloud with one click. For more information, see [Nebula Graph Cloud Service User Guide](https://cloud-docs.nebula-cloud.io/en/posts/manage-instances/dbaas-ug-connect-nebulastudio/ "Click to go to Nebula Graph Cloud Service User Guide").

Both release distributions have different limitations. For more information, see [Limitations](st-ug-limitations.md).

## Features

Studio provides these features:

- Graphical user interface (GUI) makes Nebula Graph management more user-friendly:

  - On the **Schema** page, you can manage schemas with a graphical user interface. It helps you quickly get started with Nebula Graph.

  - On the **Console** page, you can run nGQL statements and read the results in a human-friendly way.

  - On the **Import** page, you can operate batch import of vertex and edge data with clicks, and view a real-time import log.

- On the **Explore** page, you can explore the graph data. It helps you dig the relationships among data and improves the efficiency of data analysis.

## Scenarios

You can use Studio in one of these scenarios:

- You have a dataset, and you want to explore and analyze data in a visualized way. You can use Docker Compose or Nebula Graph Cloud Service to deploy Nebula Graph and then use Studio to explore or analyze data in a visualized way.  

- You have deployed Nebula Graph and imported a dataset. You want to use a GUI to run nGQL statements or explore and analyze graph data in a visualized way.  

- You are a beginner of nGQL (Nebula Graph Query Language) and you prefer to use a GUI rather than a command-line interface (CLI) to learn the language.  

## Authentication

For Studio on Cloud, only the instance creator and the Nebula Graph Cloud Service accounts that are authorized to manipulate data in Nebula Graph can connect to Studio. For more information, see [Nebula Graph Cloud Service User Guide](https://cloud-docs.nebula-cloud.io/en/posts/manage-instances/dbaas-ug-connect-nebulastudio/ "Click to go to Nebula Graph Cloud Service User Guide").

For Docker-based Studio, authentication is not enabled in Nebula Graph by default and you can sign in to Studio with the default account and password (`user` and `password`). When authentication is enabled, you must sign in to Studio with the assigned account and password.

For more information about authentication, see [Nebula Graph Database Manual](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/manual-EN/3.build-develop-and-administration/4.account-management-statements/authentication/ "Click to go to Nebula Graph website").

# Check updates

Studio is in development. To get updated with its development, visit GitHub and read its [Changelog](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-web-docker/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG-en.md "Click to go to GitHub")

## Studio on Cloud

Studio on Cloud is deployed automatically when you create a Nebula Graph instance on Nebula Graph Cloud Service. You cannot update its version. During the public beta, v1.1.1-beta is deployed.

## Docker-based Studio

For Docker-based Studio, we recommend that you run this command in the `nebula-web-docker` directory to update the Docker image and start the service:

  ```bash
  docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
  ```

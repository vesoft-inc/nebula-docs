It requires certain technical means to ensure consistency between replicas.</p> <p>Basic principle: Raft is designed to ensure consistency between replicas. Raft uses election between replicas, and the (candidate) replica that wins more than half of the votes will become the Leader, providing external services on behalf of all replicas. The rest Followers will play backups. When the Leader fails (due to communication failure, operation and maintenance commands, etc.), the rest Followers will conduct a new round of elections and vote for a new Leader. The Leader and Followers will detect each other's survival through heartbeats and write them to the hard disk in Raft-wal mode. Replicas that do not respond to more than multiple heartbeats will be considered faulty.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Raft-wal needs to be written into the hard disk periodically. If hard disk bottlenecks to write, Raft will fail to send a heartbeat and conduct a new round of elections. If the hard disk IO is severely blocked, there will be no Leader for a long time.</p> <p>Read and write: For every writing request of the clients, the Leader will initiate a Raft-wal and synchronize it with the Followers. Only after over half replicas have received the Raft-wal will it return to the clients successfully. For every reading request of the clients, it will get to the Leader directly, while Followers will not be involved.</p> <p>Failure: Scenario 1: Take a (space) cluster of a single replica as an example. If the system has only one replica, the Leader will be itself. If failure happens, the system will be completely unavailable. Scenario 2: Take a (space) cluster of three replicas as an example. If the system has three replicas, one of them will be the Leader and the rest will be the Followers. If the Leader fails, the rest two can still vote for a new Leader (and a Follower), and the system is still available. But if any of the two Followers fails again, the system will be completely unavailable due to inadequate voters.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Raft and HDFS have different modes of duplication.

For example: <code>(v)</code>. Match tags <code>MATCH (v:player) RETURN v</code> You can specify a tag with <code>:&lt;tag_name&gt;</code> after the vertex in a pattern. Match multiple tags <code>MATCH (v:player:team) RETURN v</code> To match vertices with multiple tags, use colons (:). Match vertex properties <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v</code> <code>MATCH (v) WITH v, properties(v) as props, keys(properties(v)) as kk WHERE [i in kk where props[i] == \"Tim Duncan\"] RETURN v</code> You can specify a vertex property with <code>{&lt;prop_name&gt;: &lt;prop_value&gt;}</code> after the tag in a pattern; or use a vertex property value to get vertices directly. Match a VID. <code>MATCH (v) WHERE id(v) == 'player101' RETURN v</code> You can use the VID to match a vertex. The <code>id()</code> function can retrieve the VID of a vertex. Match multiple VIDs. <code>MATCH (v:player { name: 'Tim Duncan' })--(v2) WHERE id(v2) IN [\"player101\", \"player102\"] RETURN v2</code> To match multiple VIDs, use <code>WHERE id(v) IN [vid_list]</code>. Match connected vertices <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})--(v2) RETURN v2.player.name AS Name</code> You can use the <code>--</code> symbol to represent edges of both directions and match vertices connected by these edges. You can add a <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;</code> to the <code>--</code> symbol to specify the direction of an edge. Match paths <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})--&gt;(v2) RETURN p</code> Connected vertices and edges form a path. You can use a user-defined variable to name a path as follows. Match edges <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]-(v2) RETURN e</code><code>MATCH ()&lt;-[e]-() RETURN e</code> Besides using <code>--</code>, <code>--&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;--</code> to indicate a nameless edge, you can use a user-defined variable in a pair of square brackets to represent a named edge. For example: <code>-[e]-</code>. Match an edge type <code>MATCH ()-[e:follow]-() RETURN e</code> Just like vertices, you can specify an edge type with <code>:&lt;edge_type&gt;</code> in a pattern. For example: <code>-[e:follow]-</code>. Match edge type properties <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow{degree:95}]-&gt;(v2) RETURN e</code> <code>MATCH ()-[e]-&gt;() WITH e, properties(e) as props, keys(properties(e)) as kk WHERE [i in kk where props[i] == 90] RETURN e</code> You can specify edge type properties with <code>{&lt;prop_name&gt;: &lt;prop_value&gt;}</code> in a pattern. For example: <code>[e:follow{likeness:95}]</code>; or use an edge type property value to get edges directly. Match multiple edge types <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | :serve]-&gt;(v2) RETURN e</code> The <code>|</code> symbol can help matching multiple edge types. For example: <code>[e:follow|:serve]</code>. The English colon (:) before the first edge type cannot be omitted, but the English colon before the subsequent edge type can be omitted, such as <code>[e:follow|serve]</code>. Match multiple edges <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]-&gt;(v2)&lt;-[e:serve]-(v3) RETURN v2, v3</code> You can extend a pattern to match multiple edges in a path. Match fixed-length paths <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*2]-&gt;(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2 AS Friends</code> You can use the <code>:&lt;edge_type&gt;*&lt;hop&gt;</code> pattern to match a fixed-length path. <code>hop</code> must be a non-negative integer. The data type of <code>e</code> is the list. Match variable-length paths <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow*1..3]-&gt;(v2) RETURN v2 AS Friends</code> <code>minHop</code>: Optional. It represents the minimum length of the path. <code>minHop</code>: must be a non-negative integer. The default value is 1.<code>minHop</code> and <code>maxHop</code> are optional and the default value is 1 and infinity respectively. The data type of <code>e</code> is the list. Match variable-length paths with multiple edge types <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e:follow | serve*2]-&gt;(v2) RETURN DISTINCT v2</code> You can specify multiple edge types in a fixed-length or variable-length pattern. In this case, <code>hop</code>, <code>minHop</code>, and <code>maxHop</code> take effect on all edge types. The data type of <code>e</code> is the list. Retrieve vertex or edge information <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v</code><code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]-&gt;(v2) RETURN e</code> Use <code>RETURN {&lt;vertex_name&gt; | &lt;edge_name&gt;}</code> to retrieve all the information of a vertex or an edge. Retrieve VIDs <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN id(v)</code> Use the <code>id()</code> function to retrieve VIDs. Retrieve tags <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN labels(v)</code> Use the <code>labels()</code> function to retrieve the list of tags on a vertex.To retrieve the nth element in the <code>labels(v)</code> list, use <code>labels(v)[n-1]</code>. Retrieve a single property on a vertex or an edge <code>MATCH (v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"}) RETURN v.player.age</code> Use <code>RETURN {&lt;vertex_name&gt; | &lt;edge_name&gt;}.&lt;property&gt;</code> to retrieve a single property.Use <code>AS</code> to specify an alias for a property. Retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]-&gt;(v2) RETURN properties(v2)</code> Use the <code>properties()</code> function to retrieve all properties on a vertex or an edge. Retrieve edge types <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[e]-&gt;() RETURN DISTINCT type(e)</code> Use the <code>type()</code> function to retrieve the matched edge types. Retrieve paths <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[*3]-&gt;() RETURN p</code> Use <code>RETURN &lt;path_name&gt;</code> to retrieve all the information of the matched paths. Retrieve vertices in a path <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]-&gt;(v2) RETURN nodes(p)</code> Use the <code>nodes()</code> function to retrieve all vertices in a path. Retrieve edges in a path <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[]-&gt;(v2) RETURN relationships(p)</code> Use the <code>relationships()</code> function to retrieve all edges in a path. Retrieve path length <code>MATCH p=(v:player{name:\"Tim Duncan\"})-[*..2]-&gt;(v2) RETURN p AS Paths, length(p) AS Length</code> Use the <code>length()</code> function to retrieve the length of a path. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>OPTIONAL MATCH</p> Pattern Example Description Matches patterns against your graph database, just like <code>MATCH</code> does. <code>MATCH (m)-[]-&gt;(n) WHERE id(m)==\"player100\" OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[]-&gt;(l) RETURN id(m),id(n),id(l)</code> If no matches are found, <code>OPTIONAL MATCH</code> will use a null for missing parts of the pattern. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>LOOKUP</p> <pre><code>LOOKUP ON {&lt;vertex_tag&gt; | &lt;edge_type&gt;} \n[WHERE &lt;expression&gt; [AND &lt;expression&gt; ...]] \nYIELD &lt;return_list&gt; [AS &lt;alias&gt;]\n</code></pre> Pattern Example Description Retrieve vertices <code>LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == \"Tony Parker\" YIELD player.name AS name, player.age AS age</code> The following example returns vertices whose <code>name</code> is <code>Tony Parker</code> and the tag is <code>player</code>.

The edge type name must be unique in a graph space. 2. Once the edge type name is set, it can not be altered. 3. By default, the name only supports 1-4 byte UTF-8 encoded characters, including English letters (case sensitive), numbers, Chinese characters, etc. However, it cannot include special characters other than the underscore (_), and cannot start with a number. 4. To use special characters, reserved keywords, or start with a number, quote the entire name with backticks (`) and do not include periods (<code>.</code>) within the pair of backticks (`). For more information, see Keywords and reserved words. Note:1. If you name an edge type in Chinese and encounter a <code>SyntaxError</code>, you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (`). 2. To include a backtick (`) in an edge type name, use a backslash to escape the backtick, such as \\`; to include a backslash, the backslash itself also needs to be escaped, such as \\ . <code>&lt;prop_name&gt;</code> The name of the property.

The default value can be a literal value or an expression supported by NebulaGraph. If no value is specified, the default value is used when inserting a new edge. <code>COMMENT</code> The remarks of a certain property or the edge type itself. The maximum length is 256 bytes. By default, there will be no comments on an edge type. <code>TTL_DURATION</code> Specifies the life cycle for the property. The property that exceeds the specified TTL expires. The expiration threshold is the <code>TTL_COL</code> value plus the <code>TTL_DURATION</code>. The default value of <code>TTL_DURATION</code> is <code>0</code>.

Uniquely identifies a graph space in a NebulaGraph instance. 2. Space names cannot be modified after they are set. 3. By default, the name only supports 1-4 byte UTF-8 encoded characters, including English letters (case sensitive), numbers, Chinese characters, etc. However, it cannot include special characters other than the underscore (_), and cannot start with a number. 4. To use special characters, reserved keywords, or start with a number, quote the entire name with backticks (`) and do not include periods (<code>.</code>) within the pair of backticks (`). For more information, see Keywords and reserved words. Note:1. If you name a space in Chinese and encounter a <code>SyntaxError</code>, you need to quote the Chinese characters with backticks (`). 2. To include a backtick (`) in a space name, use a backslash to escape the backtick, such as \\`; to include a backslash, the backslash itself also needs to be escaped, such as \\ . <code>partition_num</code> Specifies the number of partitions in each replica. The suggested value is 20 times (2 times for HDD) the number of the hard disks in the cluster. For example, if you have three hard disks in the cluster, we recommend that you set 60 partitions. The default value is 100. <code>replica_factor</code> Specifies the number of replicas in the cluster. The suggested number is 3 in a production environment and 1 in a test environment. The replica number must be an odd number for the need of quorum-based voting. The default value is 1. <code>vid_type</code> A required parameter. Specifies the VID type in a graph space. Available values are <code>FIXED_STRING(N)</code> and <code>INT64</code>. <code>INT</code> equals to <code>INT64</code>. <code>`FIXED_STRING(&lt;N&gt;)</code> specifies the VID as a string, while <code>INT64</code> specifies it as an integer. <code>N</code> represents the maximum length of the VIDs. If you set a VID that is longer than <code>N</code> bytes, NebulaGraph throws an error. Note, for UTF-8 chars, the length may vary in different cases, i.e. a UTF-8 Chinese char is 3 byte, this means 11 Chinese chars(length-33) will exeed a FIXED_STRING(32) vid defination. <code>COMMENT</code> The remarks of the graph space.

RocksDB is a storage engine based on the hard disk, providing a series of APIs for creating and importing SST files to help quickly import massive data.</p> <p>The SST file is an internal file containing an arbitrarily long set of ordered key-value pairs for efficient storage of large amounts of key-value data. The entire process of generating SST files is mainly done by Exchange Reader, sstProcessor, and sstWriter. The whole data processing steps are as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Reader reads data from the data source.</p> </li> <li> <p>sstProcessor generates the SST file from the NebulaGraph's Schema information and uploads it to the HDFS.

When generating SST files, keys must be written in sequence.</p> </li> <li> <p>After the SST file is generated, RocksDB imports the SST file into NebulaGraph using the <code>IngestExternalFile()</code> method.

Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that provides a unified entry point for accessing multiple services.
